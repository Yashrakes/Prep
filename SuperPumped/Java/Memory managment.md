Memory management in Java.

Memory management in Java is handled automatically by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) using Garbage Collection (GC). However, understanding how memory is structured and how to optimize its usage is essential for writing efficient and scalable Java applications.

1. Memory Areas in JVM

    Heap	: Stores objects and class   
                 instances. This is where GC      operates.

  Stack : 	Stores method call frames    and local variables. Each thread has its own stack.

 Method Area: 	Stores class metadata, method code, static variables (part of metaspace in modern JVMs).

 PC Register: 	Stores address of current executing instruction of the thread.

 Native Method: Stack	Supports
 native (non-Java) method execution.


  ‚ú≥Ô∏è Types of Garbage Collectors:

Serial GC	Single-threaded, best for small applications.

Parallel GC	Multi-threaded, suitable for high-throughput applications.

CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep)	Reduces pause time; works concurrently with application threads.

G1 (Garbage First)	Breaks heap into regions; balances pause time and throughput.

ZGC / Shenandoah	Very low pause collectors for large heaps (JDK 11+).


üß† How Java Memory Management Works

Step-by-Step:

1. Object Creation: Objects are created on the heap using new.


2. Reference Assignment: Stack variables (like method locals) store references to objects in the heap.


3. Reachability Analysis: GC identifies unreachable objects (no references pointing to them).


4. Garbage Collection: GC reclaims memory used by unreachable objects.

üßπ Tips for Effective Memory Management

‚úÖ Best Practices

Practice	Description

Avoiding memory leaks	Unintentionally keeping object references alive can cause memory leaks.

 Use tools like VisualVM or Eclipse MAT to detect them.

Use weak references	

WeakReference, SoftReference etc. help when caching objects without preventing GC.

Close resources	Use try-with-resources to automatically close streams, sockets, DB connections.

Use primitive types wisely	Prefer int over Integer when boxing/unboxing is not needed.

Avoid unnecessary object creation	Reuse immutable objects and use StringBuilder instead of + in loops.

Monitor heap usage	Use JVM options (-Xms, -Xmx) and monitoring tools like JConsole, VisualVM, or Java Mission Control.

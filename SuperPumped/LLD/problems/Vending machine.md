Candidate: Certainly! Here's my understanding of the Vending Machine System:

• The system will manage products within a single vending machine.

• Users can browse, select, and purchase products based on their preferences.

• The system tracks product availability and prevents dispensing unavailable items.

• Payment processing is integrated for coin-based payments only.

• The system transitions through various states during the purchase cycle.

Is this the expected flow?


**Point 1: Clarifying Requirements:**

Interviewer: We want a system that:

• Supports multiple product types within a single vending machine.

• Handles coin-based payments methods efficiently.

• Manages the state transitions of the vending machine during operations.

‍

Candidate: To summarize, the key requirements are:

• A system with a vending machine containing various product categories.

• State management to handle the flow from product selection to dispensing.

• Coin-based payment implementation to support various payment methods.

• Ability to handle edge cases like out-of-stock items, payment failures, or machine maintenance.

‍

**Point 2: Approach:**
Candidate: I propose using design patterns effectively. Here are my strategies:

1. State Pattern for Machine States:

○ Encapsulates state-specific behavior.

○ Manages transitions between states (ready, item selected, payment pending, dispensing, maintenance).

○ Prevents invalid operations based on current state.

‍

2. Strategy Pattern for Payment Methods:

○ Enables different payment strategies (cash, credit card, mobile payment).

○ Can switch between payment methods dynamically.

○ Encapsulates payment processing logic.


**Point 3: implementation:**


STATE interface -> public void clickOnInsertCoinButton(VendingMachine machine) throws Exception;
    public void clickOnStartProductSelectionButton(VendingMachine machine) throws Exception;
    public void insertCoin(VendingMachine machine , Coin coin) throws Exception;
    public void chooseProduct(VendingMachine machine, int codeNumber) throws Exception;
    public int getChange(int returnChangeMoney) throws Exception;
    public Item dispenseProduct(VendingMachine machine, int codeNumber) throws Exception;
    public List<Coin> refundFullMoney(VendingMachine machine) throws Exception;
    public void updateInventory(VendingMachine machine, Item item, int codeNumber) throws Exception;

IDLE STATE.  -> clickOnInsertCoinButton, updateInventory
HASMONEY STATE -> clickOnStartProductSelectionButton, refundFullMoney,insertCoin
 SELECTION STATE -> chooseProduct, `refundFullMoney`
 DISPENNSE STATE -> `dispenseProduct`


ITEM -> price , type, id
ITEMSHELF -> id,  item, soldout
ITEMTYPE -> enum
COIN-> enum 
    PENNY(1),
    NICKEL(5),
    DIME(10),
    QUARTER(25);
    public int value;
    Coin(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
INVENTORY. ->// Array to hold item shelves in the inventory temShelf[] inventory = null;

VENDINGMACHINE -> `vendingMachineState`, `List<Coin>`, `Inventory`

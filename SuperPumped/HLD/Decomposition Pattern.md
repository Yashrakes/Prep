# What is a Decomposition Pattern in Microservices?

A **decomposition pattern** refers to the strategy you use to break a monolithic application into smaller, independent microservices. The goal is to split the system into services that are cohesive (focused on a single responsibility) and loosely coupled (minimizing dependencies on each other). This enables independent development, deployment, and scaling while aligning services with business domains or technical boundaries.

# Types

### **A. Domain-Driven Decomposition (Bounded Contexts)**

- **What It Is:**  
    This approach leverages Domain-Driven Design (DDD) by decomposing the system into bounded contexts, where each microservice encapsulates a specific domain or subdomain of the business.
- **When to Use:**  
    Use this when the business domain is complex and can be broken into distinct areas that have different models, rules, and data.
- **Real-World Use Case:**
    - **Online Banking:**  
        Separate services for account management, transaction processing, fraud detection, and customer support. Each service handles its own domain logic without interfering with others.

### **B. Decomposition by Business Capability**

- **What It Is:**  
    This pattern aligns microservices with distinct business functions or capabilities. Each service is built around a core business process.
- **When to Use:**  
    Ideal when your organization is structured around clear business functions, and you want to empower independent teams to own and evolve each capability.
- **Real-World Use Case:**
    - **E-Commerce Platform:**  
        Independent services for product catalog, order management, payments, shipping, and customer reviews. This enables each team to scale and deploy their service independently based on demand.

### **C. Decomposition by Transaction Boundaries**

- **What It Is:**  
    Services are decomposed based on transactional boundaries, meaning that operations which require strong consistency and share a common transactional scope are grouped together.
- **When to Use:**  
    Use this when certain business operations need to be executed within a single transaction for data integrity.
- **Real-World Use Case:**
    - **Travel Booking System:**  
        Separate services for flight booking, hotel reservations, and car rentals. Each service handles its own transaction, ensuring that inconsistencies (like overbooking) do not occur due to cross-service transactional boundaries.

### **D. Decomposition by Subdomain**

- **What It Is:**  
    In this approach, you break down the system into core, supporting, and generic subdomains. Each microservice represents a logical grouping of functionality aligned with these subdomains.
- **When to Use:**  
    Best when your system contains distinct subdomains with varying levels of strategic importance.
- **Real-World Use Case:**
    - **Healthcare System:**  
        A core subdomain might include patient management, a supporting subdomain could involve appointment scheduling, and a generic subdomain might cover billing. This separation allows critical operations to remain robust while less critical services can evolve more freely.

# Interview Questions

## **Q1: How do you handle data consistency when decomposing a monolith into microservices?**

**Model Answer:**  
In a microservices architecture, data consistency is often managed using eventual consistency models and patterns like the Saga pattern for distributed transactions. Each microservice owns its own database, and state changes are communicated via asynchronous events or messages (using event-driven architectures). For operations that require strong consistency within a single transaction, you can design services to handle their own transactional boundaries. Using compensating transactions or versioning helps reconcile conflicts when services eventually synchronize. This way, you maintain a balance between independence of services and overall system consistency.

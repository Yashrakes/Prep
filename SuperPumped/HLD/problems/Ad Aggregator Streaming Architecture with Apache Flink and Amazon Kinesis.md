## 📌 Overview: What is an Ad Aggregator?
An **Ad Aggregator** is a system that collects advertisements from multiple sources (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, DSPs, etc.), normalizes the data, and provides ranked, filtered, and targeted ads to users in real time.

### Core Functions:
- Ingest real-time events: impressions, clicks, conversions, etc.
- Enrich and normalize data from multiple ad sources.
- Apply filters, targeting logic, and fraud detection.
- Maintain budget caps and frequency capping.
- Generate real-time metrics and dashboards.

## 📡 Streaming in Ad Aggregator

### Why use streaming?
Ad systems need to react instantly. Streaming enables:
- Real-time ad performance tracking
- Instant fraud detection
- Real-time dashboards and alerting
- Event-driven workflows (bids, budgets, targeting updates)

## 🏗️ Lambda Architecture in Ad Aggregator

**Lambda = Batch Layer + Speed Layer + Serving Layer**

### Components:
- **Batch Layer:** Periodic ETL jobs (Spark, Hadoop) for deep analytics
- **Speed Layer:** Real-time processing (Flink/Kafka Streams) for low latency
- **Serving Layer:** Merges batch + real-time results

### Example:
```text
Event: User clicks an ad
→ Speed Layer: Real-time fraud check and counter update
→ Batch Layer: Nightly recompute of click patterns
→ Serving Layer: Combines results for reports/dashboard
```

✅ Pros: Accuracy + real-time  
❌ Cons: Two code paths, complex to maintain

---

## 🧱 Kappa Architecture in Ad Aggregator

**Kappa = Stream-only architecture**

- No separate batch layer
- Replayable logs (Kafka/Kinesis) used for reprocessing
- Same codebase for real-time and historical

### Example:
```text
Event: Ad impression → Kafka/Kinesis → Flink job → real-time enrichment → Redis
```

✅ Pros: Simple, unified logic  
❌ Cons: Reprocessing cost with large historical data

## 🔄 Amazon Kinesis in Ad Aggregator

### What is Kinesis?
A fully-managed AWS streaming platform for ingesting real-time data.

### Role in Ad Aggregator:
- **Kinesis Data Streams (KDS):** Ingest high-velocity events (clicks, impressions)
- **Kinesis Firehose:** Push data to S3, Redshift (if needed)
- **Kinesis Data Analytics:** Fully managed Apache Flink for stream processing

### Flow:
```text
Ad Events → Kinesis Streams → Apache Flink → Redis / Druid / S3
```

## ⚙️ Apache Flink in Ad Aggregator

### What is Flink?
A distributed, stateful stream processing engine designed for high-throughput, low-latency computation on data streams.

### Key Concepts:
- **Streams:** Unbounded (infinite) or bounded (finite) data
- **Operators:** Transformations like map, filter, window, reduce
- **State:** Per-key state, window buffers, joins, counters
- **Event-time & Watermarks:** Accurate time-based windowing
- **Checkpoints & Savepoints:** Fault tolerance and recovery
- **Sinks:** Redis, Kafka, S3, ElasticSearch, JDBC, etc.

### How Flink Works (Step-by-Step):
1. You write a job using DataStream API (e.g., map, window, reduce)
2. Flink creates a DAG (dataflow graph)
3. JobManager schedules tasks across TaskManagers
4. Streams flow, tasks update internal state
5. State is checkpointed to durable storage (S3, HDFS, etc.)
6. Results are emitted to sinks

### Does Flink Recalculate Everything?
**No!** Flink processes events **incrementally**, not repeatedly.
- Maintains state (e.g., CTR, click counts) per key
- Updates only what's new
- Emits output on condition (e.g., when a window closes)
- Fault tolerance via periodic checkpoints

### When Flink *would* reprocess the stream:
- You restore from an earlier savepoint
- You replay Kafka/Kinesis topic (e.g., for bug fix)
- You modify job logic significantly

## 🖼️ Summary of Roles

| Component     | Role in Ad Aggregator                            |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Kinesis**   | Real-time ingestion of ad events                 |
| **Flink**     | Stateful stream processing (enrich, filter, agg) |
| **Redis/Sinks** | Store output of real-time analytics             |

---

## ✅ Final Takeaways

- Flink and Kinesis make a powerful combo for real-time data pipelines.
- Flink processes each event once, incrementally, with strong fault tolerance.
- Choose **Lambda** if you need batch + real-time accuracy.
- Choose **Kappa** if simplicity and unified stream processing matters more.

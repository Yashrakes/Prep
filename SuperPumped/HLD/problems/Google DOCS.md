## üß© The Real Problem

When multiple servers or replicas handle user edits (like in Google Docs, or in any multi-leader setup), we want:

- Each change to have a **unique and causally ordered version**.
    
- Even if two servers generate updates at the same logical time, they must not collide or be confused as the same version.
    

So your concern:

> "How can two servers not send the same vector version `v2 v2` to the database?"

is about **ensuring globally unique version vectors** (or timestamps) across servers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Concepts Involved

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Vector Clock**|A vector of counters, one per node (server), used to capture causality.|
|**Lamport Timestamp**|A single scalar that increases monotonically and encodes partial ordering.|
|**CRDT**|Conflict-free replicated data type ‚Äî used in systems like Google Docs for auto-merge.|
|**CDC**|Change Data Capture ‚Äî records changes into a central stream or database.|

## üîë How Google Docs (and Similar Systems) Avoid Version Collisions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Each Server Has Its Own Unique Identity**

- Every replica/server has a unique ID (e.g., `server_1`, `server_2`, ...).
    
- The vector clock is indexed by server ID.
    
- Example vector clocks:
    
    `Server 1: [s1:2, s2:0, s3:0] Server 2: [s1:1, s2:3, s3:0]`
    
- Even if both servers are at "version 2" locally, their vector clocks differ because they increment their **own index only**.
    

üëâ So there‚Äôs no collision: the tuple includes both the **server ID** and its **local counter**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Server Updates Only Its Own Counter**

Each replica maintains:

`vector[server_id] += 1`

when it creates an update.

When it receives an update from another server, it merges by taking:

`vector[i] = max(vector[i], incoming_vector[i])`

Hence, even if two servers update concurrently, their vectors differ in different indices:

`S1 update ‚Üí [1, 0] S2 update ‚Üí [0, 1]`

and later, after merge:

`[1, 1]`

So there‚Äôs never a duplicate `[1, 1]` emitted from two sources independently.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Server-Scoped Versioning in CDC Streams**

In systems like **Google Docs, Spanner, DynamoDB Streams, Kafka**, or **Debezium**, each event is usually tagged with:

- The **replica ID** (origin server)
    
- The **local sequence number**
    
- Possibly a **hybrid timestamp** (`physical time + logical counter`)
    

Hence each change event key looks like:

`(change_id = server_id + logical_counter)`

Example:

`server_1:4 server_2:4`

Even though both are ‚Äúversion 4‚Äù, the **composite key is unique**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC) in Practice**

Instead of pure vector clocks, large systems (Google Spanner, CockroachDB, YugabyteDB) use **HLCs**:

`timestamp = (physical_time_in_ms, logical_counter)`

If two updates have same physical time, the logical counter breaks ties.  
Each node ensures uniqueness by attaching its own node ID.

So global uniqueness = `(HLC, node_id)`.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Central Conflict Resolution (in CDC Consumers)**

When changes are replicated via CDC:

- The consumer (say, a ‚Äúmerge‚Äù service or operational transform engine) merges them **causally**.
    
- It uses vector timestamps or CRDT semantics to determine if updates:
    
    - are **causally ordered**, or
        
    - are **concurrent** and must be merged.
        

So even if two CDC entries arrive with ‚Äúsame version‚Äù numbers (from different servers), the system disambiguates using their **origin server ID**.

---

### üß† Example ‚Äî Simplified Google Docs Flow

|Step|Action|
|---|---|
|1|User A edits on Server 1 ‚Üí generates `(server_1, counter=5)`|
|2|User B edits on Server 2 ‚Üí generates `(server_2, counter=5)`|
|3|Both updates go to Firestore/Spanner ‚Üí CDC sends `(s1,5)` and `(s2,5)`|
|4|The OT/CRDT merge layer merges them causally using vectors: `[s1:5, s2:4]` vs `[s1:4, s2:5]`|
|5|Resulting doc state is merged ‚Üí new global version `[s1:5, s2:5]`|

So they **can have the same local number** (`5`),  
but the **(server_id, version)** tuple ensures uniqueness and causal ordering.

---

### üß© TL;DR

|Problem|Solution|
|---|---|
|Multiple servers might send same ‚Äúv2‚Äù|Each server has its **own counter** in the vector clock|
|Same physical time on two nodes|Add **logical counter** or **server ID**|
|CDC might see same version from two nodes|Use **composite key (server_id + logical_ts)**|
|Merge conflicts|Use **CRDTs / Operational Transformations** to resolve|

---

### üîê One-Liner Summary

> **Google Docs** (and systems like it) avoid ‚Äúsame version collisions‚Äù because every update is tagged with the **origin server ID and its own logical counter or hybrid timestamp**, making each version globally unique ‚Äî even when multiple servers update concurrently.

Would you like me to show a **diagram or timeline** of how two Google Docs servers generate updates and merge them using vector clocks or HLCs? It‚Äôs really intuitive once visualized.

##### You said:

didnt understood the versionning telll em giving example

###### ChatGPT said:

Perfect üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs slow it down and go step-by-step with a **real example** to make **versioning across multiple servers** super clear.

We‚Äôll take a simple **Google Docs‚Äìlike system**, where:

- Multiple **servers** handle edits.
    
- Each edit gets a **version number**.
    
- We must ensure **two servers never create the same version** (like both saying `v2` for different changes).
    

---

## üß© Setup

Let‚Äôs say:

- Server A = handles User 1
    
- Server B = handles User 2
    
- Both are editing **the same document**
    

We‚Äôll see how ‚Äúversion numbers‚Äù work if they both send changes.

---

## ‚ùå Naive (Wrong) Approach: Simple Counter

Suppose both servers just use a **simple integer version**:

|Server|Action|Version|Sent to DB|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|First edit|v1|v1|
|B|First edit|v1|v1|

üëâ Now the database sees **two different edits** with **the same version (v1)** ‚Äî **collision!**  
We cannot tell which one came first, or if they happened concurrently.

This is what you‚Äôre worried about ‚Äî ‚Äútwo servers sending same vector version to CDC‚Äù.

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Approach: **Per-Server Versioning**

Instead of a single global version, we give **each server its own version counter**.  
That‚Äôs how **vector clocks** work.

Let‚Äôs see an example.

---

## üß† Example: Vector Clock System

We have **two servers**, so each version has **two numbers** ‚Äî one for each server.

|Meaning|Example Vector Clock|
|---|---|
|Version from Server A|`[A:1, B:0]`|
|Version from Server B|`[A:0, B:1]`|
|After merging both edits|`[A:1, B:1]`|

---

### üß© Step-by-Step Flow

#### Step 1 ‚Äî Server A makes first edit

`Server A increments its own counter: A: [1, 0]`

Stores ‚Üí

`(change_id = serverA, version = 1)`

#### Step 2 ‚Äî Server B makes first edit

`Server B increments its own counter: B: [0, 1]`

Stores ‚Üí

`(change_id = serverB, version = 1)`

So database now has:

|change_id|version|vector_clock|
|---|---|---|
|serverA|1|[A:1, B:0]|
|serverB|1|[A:0, B:1]|

‚úÖ Notice:  
Even though both versions = 1, they‚Äôre from **different servers**.  
So `(server_id, version)` pair is **unique**.

---

### Step 3 ‚Äî Both updates get merged

When a sync or CDC consumer merges these:

`merged_vector = max([1,0], [0,1]) = [1,1]`

That means:

- Document has incorporated ServerA‚Äôs first edit.
    
- Document has incorporated ServerB‚Äôs first edit.
    

Next time either server makes a change, it increments **its own index only**:

- If A edits again ‚Üí [2,1]
    
- If B edits again ‚Üí [1,2]
    

Now everything has a clear, causal ordering:

`[2,1]  > [1,1]  (A happened after both) [1,2]  > [1,1]  (B happened after both)`

---

## üí° What if we don‚Äôt want vectors?

Large systems like **Spanner, DynamoDB, MongoDB**, etc., often use **Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC)**.

Each version looks like:

`(timestamp = physical_time + logical_counter, server_id)`

Example:

|Server|Physical Time|Logical Counter|Version|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|10:00:00.100|1|(100ms,1,A)|
|B|10:00:00.100|2|(100ms,2,B)|

Even if physical times match, logical counter + server_id keep them unique.

---

## üîê What Gets Stored in Database or CDC Stream

Each change usually carries:

`change_id = <server_id, local_version> vector_clock = full vector (optional) timestamp = hybrid_logical_time`

So even if both servers independently generate ‚Äúv2‚Äù,  
the database sees them as:

|change_id|version|server_id|
|---|---|---|
|doc1|2|serverA|
|doc1|2|serverB|

CDC consumers merge them **by server ID**, not by global version.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Summary

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Each server has its **own version counter**|It only increments its own index|
|Updates identified as `(server_id, version)`|Ensures global uniqueness|
|Merging uses `max()` across vectors|Builds a global causal version|
|CDC merges by origin server|Avoids same-version collisions|
|Optionally, HLC = `(physical_time, logical, server_id)`|Globally unique timestamp ordering|

---

### TL;DR Example in One Line:

`ServerA makes edit ‚Üí version [A:2, B:0] ServerB makes edit ‚Üí version [A:0, B:2] Database never confuses them because key = (server_id, version) Merged version becomes [A:2, B:2]`

---

## ✅ 1. Functional Requirements

- Users can schedule jobs at a future time.
    
- Jobs should execute at the exact scheduled time.
    
- Jobs can be retried on failure.
    
- Users can check job status (queued, running, failed, completed).
    
- System should handle millions of jobs per day.
    

---

## 🧰 2. Non-Functional Requirements

|NFR|Why?|
|---|---|
|**Scalability**|To handle millions of jobs concurrently.|
|**High availability**|Jobs must not be lost or skipped.|
|**Accuracy (timing)**|Execution must match scheduled time.|
|**Durability**|Job metadata and results must persist.|
|**Observability**|Logs/metrics for debugging and monitoring.|
|**At-least-once delivery**|Prevent job loss during retries/crashes.|

---

## 🧱 3. Component-Wise Architecture (Explained from Diagram)

### 🖥️ **Client/API Gateway/Load Balancer**

- Clients send job scheduling requests via REST APIs.
    
- API Gateway routes requests to backend services.
    
- Load balancer ensures horizontal scaling.
    

**💡 Why API Gateway + LB?**

- Gateway allows auth, rate limiting, and versioning.
    
- Load balancer enables zero-downtime deployments and autoscaling.
    

---

### 🧠 **Scheduler Service**

- Accepts the job request and stores it in **DynamoDB**.
    
- Writes include: job ID, execution time, payload, retries, status.
    
- Updates job status (e.g. “scheduled” → “queued” → “done”).
    

**💡 Why this?**

- Stateless microservice – easily horizontally scalable.
    
- DynamoDB is a NoSQL DB with millisecond read/write for massive scale.
    

**🔁 Alternatives:**

- Use PostgreSQL for relational querying (but less scalable at massive scale).
    
- Use Redis for speed but adds durability risk.
    

---

### 🗃️ **DynamoDB**

- Stores scheduled jobs with TTLs or indexed timestamps.
    
- Used to **fetch upcoming jobs** due for execution.
    

**💡 Why DynamoDB?**

- High write throughput.
    
- TTL can auto-delete old jobs.
    
- Scales seamlessly.
    

**🔁 Alternatives:**

- RDBMS (strong consistency, but bottleneck on scale).
    
- MongoDB (document DB, eventual consistency may hurt timing).
    

---

### 👀 **Watcher Service (Lambda)**

- Polls DynamoDB for jobs due in the next X seconds.
    
- Fetches job payloads from **S3**.
    
- Pushes job IDs into the **SQS queue**.
    

**💡 Why Lambda?**

- Stateless, event-driven.
    
- Cost-efficient and autoscaling.
    
- Ideal for scheduled polling.
    

**💡 Why S3?**

- Job payloads (especially large ones) offloaded from DB to S3.
    
- Cheap, durable, scalable object storage.
    

**🔁 Alternatives:**

- Use Kafka topic instead of SQS (but adds infra and overhead).
    
- Store payload inline in DynamoDB (limited size, higher cost).
    

---

### 📨 **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**

- Stores enqueued jobs to be executed soon.
    
- Acts as a **buffer** between producer (watcher) and consumer (executor).
    
- Guarantees **at-least-once delivery**.
    

**💡 Why SQS?**

- Managed queueing.
    
- DLQ support, retries, visibility timeout.
    
- FIFO queue possible if strict ordering is needed.
    

**🔁 Alternatives:**

- Kafka (better for stream processing, supports replays).
    
- RabbitMQ (advanced routing, but needs manual scaling).
    

---

### ⚙️ **Executor Service**

- Consumes jobs from SQS.
    
- Executes the job logic (API calls, database tasks, etc.).
    
- Updates job status in DynamoDB.
    

**💡 Why separate Executor?**

- Decouples job logic from scheduling.
    
- Can run long-running/complex tasks independently.
    

**Tradeoff:** Must handle retries, idempotency.

---

## 🔄 4. End-to-End Flow (with Callouts)

1. **User Schedules Job →**
    
    - API Gateway → Load Balancer → Scheduler Service.
        
    - Job stored in DynamoDB + payload to S3.
        
2. **Watcher Service (Lambda) Triggered (Every 30s?) →**
    
    - Scans DynamoDB for `execution_time <= now + 1 minute`.
        
    - Pulls payload from S3.
        
    - Enqueues jobs to SQS.
        
3. **Executor Picks from SQS →**
    
    - Executes job logic.
        
    - Updates DynamoDB status.
        
    - If failure, retries up to N times.

## ⚖️ 5. Trade-offs and Alternatives

|Area|Current Design|Alternatives|Trade-offs|
|---|---|---|---|
|**DB**|DynamoDB|PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis|Tradeoff between speed, durability, schema|
|**Queue**|SQS|Kafka, RabbitMQ|SQS is simple but Kafka allows replays|
|**Polling**|Lambda Watcher|Cron job, Kinesis triggers|Lambda is scalable but might have cold starts|
|**Storage**|S3 for payloads|Inline DB, Redis|S3 is cost-effective but higher latency|
|**Execution**|Executor service|Step Functions, ECS Tasks|Step Functions offer retry logic out of box|

---

## 🔍 6. Tricky Interview Follow-up Questions

### 🔸 Q1: What if Watcher fails? Will jobs get missed?

**A:** No. Watcher polls in intervals. As long as jobs aren't deleted, they can be picked later.

---

### 🔸 Q2: How do you ensure **exact execution time**?

**A:** By configuring the Watcher polling window carefully (e.g., `now` to `now + 1 minute`) and preloading the SQS before job time.

---

### 🔸 Q3: What if a job fails?

**A:** Retry logic in executor or use **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** in SQS.

---

### 🔸 Q4: How to ensure idempotency?

**A:** Each job carries a unique ID. Executor checks job status before running to avoid duplicate execution.

---

### 🔸 Q5: How does the system scale?

**A:** Stateless components + SQS decoupling + DynamoDB horizontal scaling.

---

### 🔸 Q6: Why not use cron or Quartz?

**A:** Not scalable beyond a few thousand jobs. Cron is local, no retry or distributed control.

## 🧠 7. Analogies

|Component|Analogy|
|---|---|
|Scheduler|Admin office taking job requests|
|DynamoDB|Filing cabinet storing job forms|
|S3|Archive room storing big documents|
|Watcher|Clerk checking which job is due|
|SQS|Conveyor belt moving job packets|
|Executor|Worker performing each task|

---

## ✅ Summary of Why This Design Is Great

- Scalable
    
- Modular
    
- Durable (via S3 + DynamoDB)
    
- Event-driven (SQS + Lambda)
    
- Cloud-native (uses managed AWS services)
    
- Cost-efficient (no always-on compute except Executor)

Let me know if you want this written as a **45-minute talk script**, with proper sections, or want to **simulate a mock interview**.

##### You said:

can sqs cannot allow replays , and why would i use kafka here when i need to execute jobs in oreder, so in that case therre would be only one partition

###### ChatGPT said:

Great questions! Let’s break this down clearly:

---

## ❓ **1. Can SQS allow replays?**

### ✅ **Short Answer:**

**No**, **SQS does not support replays** once a message is consumed and deleted.

---

### 📘 **Explanation:**

- **Standard SQS:**
    
    - Messages are **best-effort ordered**, **at-least-once delivery**.
        
    - Once a consumer **acknowledges (deletes)** a message, it's **gone forever**.
        
    - No concept of a “cursor” or offset for re-reading past messages.
        
- **FIFO SQS:**
    
    - Preserves **strict ordering** within a “message group”.
        
    - Still, **no message replay** after it's been deleted.
        
    - No ability to rewind or reprocess older messages.
        

> So: **SQS is a “fire-and-forget” queue. Once acknowledged, messages are not retained.**

---

## ❓ **2. Why would I use Kafka in a Job Scheduler if I need ordered execution?**

### ✅ **Short Answer:**

Kafka is used **when you want replays, durability, and stream processing**, **not just job queuing**.

But for **strict job ordering**, **only one partition** per ordered stream is needed.

---

### 🔍 **So what happens if I need strict ordering?**

- In Kafka, **ordering is guaranteed only within a single partition**.
    
- So if you want **jobs to be executed strictly in order**, you’d:
    
    - Use **a single partition**, OR
        
    - Use **partitioning by job group (e.g., job type, user ID)** so ordering is guaranteed per group.
        

---

### 🆚 SQS vs Kafka for Job Scheduling

|Feature|SQS (FIFO)|Kafka|
|---|---|---|
|**Replay capability**|❌ Not possible|✅ Consumer can replay from offset|
|**Ordering**|✅ FIFO mode with MessageGroupId|✅ Only within a partition|
|**Visibility timeout**|✅ Supported|❌ Not natively (must handle at consumer)|
|**Use case**|Fire-and-forget task queues|Stream processing, audit, reprocessing|
|**Durability**|✅ 4-day retention by default|✅ Configurable (even infinite retention)|
|**Fan-out consumers**|One consumer group processes and deletes|Multiple consumer groups with offsets|
|**Autoscaling**|✅ Fully managed (Lambda, ECS, etc.)|🚧 You manage scaling (Brokers, partitions)|

---

## 🧠 Example: Ordered Job Execution

### Let’s say:

You have a **user** who submits 3 jobs:

kotlin

CopyEdit

`Job 1 → Job 2 → Job 3 (MUST be executed in this exact order)`

### ❗Problem: Parallel consumers can violate ordering.

### ✅ **Solution Options:**

#### 1. **SQS FIFO Queue**:

- Use same **MessageGroupId = userId** for all 3 jobs.
    
- SQS guarantees in-order processing for messages within a group.
    
- Downside: No replay, limited throughput per group.
    

#### 2. **Kafka with One Partition**:

- Use **one partition** (or partition by user ID).
    
- Only **one consumer thread** can process that partition at a time.
    
- You get **replay, ordering, durability**.
    
- Downside: Low parallelism if only one partition.
    

---

## ✅ Summary

|Question|Answer|
|---|---|
|**Can SQS support replay?**|❌ No, once consumed and deleted, messages are gone.|
|**Why use Kafka if I need ordering?**|✅ Use 1 partition or partition by group key to maintain order.|
|**Downside of 1 partition in Kafka?**|❗Limited parallelism — only 1 consumer can read from it at a time.|
|**When to use SQS?**|✅ Simple job queue with limited or no need for reprocessing.|
|**When to use Kafka?**|✅ If you need replays, large scale, or stream processing capabilities.|

Want help with a **Kafka-based job scheduler design** or a **hybrid of SQS + Kafka**, where SQS is used for ordering and Kafka for audits or retries?

##### You said:

why does we need queue here , why watchlist service directly read jobs and sent executor service to execute

###### ChatGPT said:

Excellent question — this is exactly the kind of insight interviewers look for!

Let’s dig into:

---

## ❓ Why do we need a **Queue (SQS/Kafka)** between **Watcher Service** and **Executor Service**?

---

## 🔧 Architectural Purpose of the Queue

### Without a Queue (Direct Call):

- Watcher reads a job → Directly invokes Executor Service.
    
- Sounds simple, but comes with **significant risks** and trade-offs.
    

---

## ✅ Why We Introduce a Queue (SQS in your diagram)

|🔍 **Reason**|📘 **Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**1. Decoupling of components**|Queue allows **Watcher** and **Executor** to work **independently**. Watcher can enqueue jobs and move on, even if Executor is down.|
|**2. Load leveling**|If Watcher finds 1000 jobs suddenly, it can push all of them to the queue quickly, and Executor can **process at its own pace**, based on available resources.|
|**3. Retry & durability**|If Executor crashes, the job **remains in queue** until visibility timeout expires. It can be **retried**.|
|**4. Horizontal scaling of Executors**|Multiple Executor instances can **pull from the same queue** — enables **parallelism and scalability**.|
|**5. Failure isolation**|If Executor crashes or hangs, Watcher isn’t impacted. No backpressure hits Watcher.|
|**6. Buffering spikes**|If job spike happens (say 100k jobs in 10 mins), the queue **buffers** the jobs instead of overwhelming Executors.|
|**7. Visibility & observability**|Queues can offer metrics: queue length, failed messages, age of oldest message — useful for autoscaling & alerting.|

---

## ❌ Problems Without Queue (Direct Call from Watcher → Executor)

|🚨 **Issue**|📉 **Impact**|
|---|---|
|No retry if Executor fails|Jobs are lost or must be re-fetched manually.|
|Backpressure on Watcher|If Executor is slow/down, Watcher will also slow down or crash.|
|Poor fault tolerance|One component's failure breaks the chain.|
|Hard to scale independently|Watcher and Executor must scale together; not good for cost or stability.|
|No audit trail|Can't trace what jobs were attempted or failed without custom tracking.|

---

## 🎯 Analogy

Imagine:

- **Watcher = Delivery Dispatcher**
    
- **Executor = Delivery Van**
    
- **Queue = Warehouse Loading Dock**
    

Would you want the dispatcher to directly hand every parcel to the delivery van **one-by-one in real-time**?  
Or drop all parcels into a loading area (queue) so vans can pick them up **when ready**?

Using a **queue** gives you buffering, flexibility, retries, and safety.

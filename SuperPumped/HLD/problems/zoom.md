## 4. ✅ Key Component Breakdown

### 1. **API Gateway**

- Entry point for all HTTP traffic (create/join meeting, chat, user info).
    
- Handles rate limiting, auth forwarding, etc.
    

---

### 2. **Auth Service**

- OAuth2 / JWT tokens.
    
- Meeting passwords or waiting room features.
    
- Role-based auth (Host, Participant, Admin).
    

---

### 3. **Meeting Service**

- Generates unique meeting IDs.
    
- Stores meeting metadata (start time, participants, config).
    
- Handles scheduling, invitations.
    

---

### 4. **Signaling Service (WebRTC)**

- Controls setup/teardown of peer connections.
    
- Exchanges SDP offers/answers, ICE candidates.
    
- Built using **WebSocket** or **gRPC bidirectional streaming**.
    
- Low latency channel for control messages.
    

---

### 5. **Media Server (SFU preferred)**

- **Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)**: Forwards video/audio streams without decoding.
    
    - Client sends stream to SFU → SFU forwards to others.
        
    - Scales better than peer-to-peer or MCU.
        
- **MCU (Multipoint Control Unit)**: Mixes streams before sending → higher CPU cost.
    

---

### 6. **Chat Service**

- Real-time text chat using **WebSockets** or **MQTT**.
    
- Messages may go through a **chat relay service** with pub/sub.
    
- Stores messages in **Message DB (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB)**.
    

---

### 7. **Recording Service**

- Triggered by host.
    
- Pulls streams from SFU and encodes into file (via FFmpeg, GStreamer).
    
- Stores on **S3 / Blob Storage**.
    
- Optional: Transcription using ML APIs.
    

---

## 5. ✅ Database Design

### User Table

| user_id | name | email | password_hash | preferences |

### Meeting Table

| meeting_id | host_id | start_time | end_time | is_recorded | passcode |

### Participant Table

| meeting_id | user_id | join_time | leave_time | role |

### Chat Messages

| message_id | meeting_id | sender_id | timestamp | content |

Use **SQL for metadata**, **NoSQL** for chat/messages, and **object storage** for video/audio files.

---

## 6. ✅ Real-Time Communication Stack

- **WebRTC**: Peer-to-peer communication stack (used for audio/video).
    
    - Includes DTLS (encryption), ICE/STUN/TURN (for NAT traversal).
        
- **SFU (Media Server)**: Needed for group meetings.
    
- **WebSocket**: For signaling, chat, control messages.
    

---

## 7. ✅ Scaling Considerations

|Component|Strategy|
|---|---|
|Media servers|Geographically distributed, stateless, auto-scaled|
|Signaling server|Horizontal scaling with sticky sessions|
|Chat|Kafka + Microservices + eventual consistency|
|Recording|Asynchronous job queues (Kafka, SQS)|
|Load balancer|GeoDNS, CDN, region-based routing|
|DB|Partitioning/sharding for user data|

---

## 8. ✅ Fault Tolerance

- **Retries & failover**: Reconnect if signaling server or SFU fails.
    
- **Redundancy**: Run multiple instances of each component.
    
- **Circuit breakers** to isolate failures.
    
- **Health checks** at load balancer level.
    

---

## 9. ✅ Security Aspects

- JWT for user auth.
    
- Token-based meeting access.
    
- DTLS + SRTP for encrypted media.
    
- Waiting room/password-protected meetings.
    
- Secure TURN servers to avoid MITM.
    

---

## 10. ✅ Trade-offs & Interview-Level Questions

|Question|Possible Answer|
|---|---|
|**Why SFU over MCU?**|SFU scales better, less CPU-intensive. MCU mixes streams—expensive.|
|**Why not P2P WebRTC for group calls?**|P2P mesh is O(n²) → unscalable for >3 users.|
|**How do you ensure global low latency?**|Deploy SFUs across regions, use closest one via latency-based routing.|
|**What happens if host drops off?**|Elect a new host or pause meeting.|
|**How to prevent unauthorized access?**|Token auth, waiting room, passcodes, role-based controls.|
|**How to handle NAT traversal?**|ICE protocol with STUN/TURN servers.|
|**How to handle network fluctuations?**|Adaptive bitrate, jitter buffer, packet retransmission.|

---

## 11. ✅ Bonus: Technologies to Mention

- **WebRTC**, **gRPC**, **WebSocket**
    
- **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **Redis**
    
- **Kafka**, **Postgres**, **Cassandra**
    
- **S3 / GCS** for recordings
    
- **ElasticSearch** for logs/monitoring
    
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for observability
    

---

## 12. ✅ Optional Add-ons

- Transcription using Google Speech / Whisper API.
    
- Integration with calendars (Google/Outlook).
    
- Breakout rooms (logical split of participants).
    
- AI features: background blur, noise cancellation.

## Summary for Interview

> _“I’ll build Zoom using a microservices architecture where a signaling service handles connection setup, and media is routed via SFUs for real-time streaming. I’d use WebRTC, Redis for pub/sub, Kafka for logs and chat, and globally distributed media servers. I'd ensure low latency with edge routing, JWT for security, and autoscaling via Kubernetes. For recordings, I’d use async jobs writing to S3. The design supports millions of users with real-time needs and fault tolerance.”_

---

## ✅ **Follow-Up Questions for Zoom System Design**

### 🔹 1. **How will you ensure low latency across the globe?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Discuss edge SFU servers, CDN-like routing, geo-based load balancing (GeoDNS), and ICE candidates' prioritization in WebRTC.

---

### 🔹 2. **What architecture would you use for group meetings — Mesh, SFU, or MCU? Why?**

> 📌 **Hint:** SFU is preferred for scalability; MCU is CPU-heavy but useful for cloud recording/mixing.

---

### 🔹 3. **What happens if one SFU fails during a call?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Failover strategy — client re-connects via signaling to another SFU; media session renegotiation.

---

### 🔹 4. **How would you handle NAT traversal and firewall issues?**

> 📌 **Hint:** STUN to discover public IP, TURN as a fallback relay. Discuss ICE protocol.

---

### 🔹 5. **How do you scale the signaling service?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Stateless services behind load balancers. Use sticky sessions or session stores (e.g., Redis) for state.

---

### 🔹 6. **How would you implement end-to-end encryption in Zoom?**

> 📌 **Hint:** WebRTC supports DTLS-SRTP. Keys exchanged during signaling. SFU breaks E2E unless it's encrypted forwarding.

---

### 🔹 7. **How do you ensure that only authorized users can join a meeting?**

> 📌 **Hint:** JWT tokens with expiration, meeting passcodes, waiting rooms, role-based access.

---

### 🔹 8. **How would you design the recording service?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Pull media from SFU, transcode using FFmpeg, store in S3, async processing via Kafka/SQS.

---

### 🔹 9. **How do you handle bad network conditions for a user?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Adaptive Bitrate (ABR), simulcast, packet retransmission (NACK), jitter buffer.

---

### 🔹 10. **What DB and schema would you use to store meeting metadata and chat?**

> 📌 **Hint:**

- Relational DB (Postgres) for metadata.
    
- NoSQL (Cassandra, DynamoDB) or Redis Streams for chat.
    
- Object storage (S3/GCS) for recordings.
    

---

### 🔹 11. **How would you handle 10,000 users joining a live webinar?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Use SFU broadcast mode (1-to-many). Consider using CDNs for truly passive viewers (streaming mode).

---

### 🔹 12. **How do you monitor system health in real time?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Prometheus/Grafana, logs via ELK stack, alerting (PagerDuty), health-check endpoints, heartbeat pings from clients.

---

### 🔹 13. **How do you manage version compatibility between client and server?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Feature flags, backward-compatible signaling protocol, deprecate old APIs gradually.

---

### 🔹 14. **How would you design chat service to support 1M messages/min?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Use Kafka as a pub-sub queue, persist to Cassandra/MongoDB, use sharded chat services.

---

### 🔹 15. **How do you secure the WebSocket connection for signaling?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Use **WSS (WebSocket Secure)** with SSL/TLS, token validation on connection, throttling & auth handshake.

---

### 🔹 16. **How do you manage participants in a distributed system?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Store participant states in Redis or in a replicated DB. Use a pub/sub system for state updates.

---

### 🔹 17. **Can two users with the same meeting link join from different regions? How is routing handled?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Yes, but signaling should direct them to nearest SFU region using latency-based routing and ICE candidates.

---

### 🔹 18. **What are the bottlenecks in this architecture?**

> 📌 **Hint:** SFU CPU/network, signaling under heavy load, recording services, TURN server under high NAT.

---

### 🔹 19. **How do you handle abuse (spam, intrusions) in public meetings?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Rate limiting, CAPTCHA, waiting rooms, banning by host, audit logs, abuse detection service.

---

### 🔹 20. **How would you unit test or simulate load on such a system?**

> 📌 **Hint:** Use load testing tools like Locust or custom WebRTC simulators, mock SFU, chaos engineering (e.g., Gremlin).

# Distributed Gaming Leaderboard: End-to-End Architecture

## System Overview

A distributed gaming leaderboard for millions of users requires a multi-layered approach that balances real-time performance with global consistency. The system must handle frequent score updates while providing sub-second query responses across global regions.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Regional Game Servers (Edge Layer)

**Purpose**: Handle immediate gameplay and score collection

- Game servers deployed in multiple regions (US-East, US-West, EU, Asia-Pacific, etc.)
- Each server maintains local player sessions and collects score events
- Implements local caching for recent player scores
- Batches score updates to reduce network overhead

**Key Functions**:

- Validate score updates for anti-cheat protection
- Apply immediate local score updates for player feedback
- Buffer score events for efficient batch processing
- Maintain regional player session state

### 2. Score Ingestion Pipeline (Stream Processing)

**Purpose**: Process and route score updates efficiently

**Message Queue System** (Apache Kafka/AWS Kinesis):

- Partitioned by player ID or region for parallel processing
- High-throughput ingestion of score events from all game servers
- Guaranteed delivery and ordering within partitions
- Retention policy for replay capability during failures

**Stream Processing Layer** (Apache Flink/Apache Storm):

- Real-time aggregation of player scores
- Duplicate detection and deduplication
- Score validation and anomaly detection
- Routing to appropriate storage systems based on score significance

### 3. Multi-Tier Storage Architecture

#### Hot Storage (Redis Cluster)

**Purpose**: Ultra-fast access to top players and recent scores

- Stores top 10,000 players globally using Redis Sorted Sets
- Regional clusters for reduced latency (sub-10ms responses)
- TTL-based eviction for players dropping out of rankings
- Cross-region replication with eventual consistency

**Data Structure Example**:

```
Global Leaderboard: ZADD global_leaderboard score player_id
Regional Leaderboards: ZADD region_us_leaderboard score player_id
Player Cache: HSET player:123 current_score 95000 rank 1247
```

#### Warm Storage (Amazon DynamoDB/Cassandra)

**Purpose**: Store all player scores with fast query capabilities

- Partitioned by player ID for even distribution
- Global secondary indexes for rank-based queries
- Handles millions of concurrent reads/writes
- Multi-region replication with configurable consistency

**Schema Design**:

```
Player Scores Table:
- Partition Key: player_id
- Sort Key: timestamp
- Attributes: current_score, game_mode, region

Leaderboard Snapshots Table:
- Partition Key: leaderboard_type (global/regional)
- Sort Key: rank
- Attributes: player_id, score, last_updated
```

#### Cold Storage (Amazon S3/HDFS)

**Purpose**: Historical data and analytics

- Daily/hourly snapshots of complete leaderboards
- Player score history for trend analysis
- Backup and disaster recovery data
- Data lake for machine learning and analytics

### 4. Leaderboard Computation Engine

#### Real-Time Updates (For Top Players)

- Immediate updates to Redis when top players' scores change
- Event-driven architecture using webhooks or message queues
- Atomic operations to maintain consistency
- Lock-free algorithms for high concurrency

#### Batch Processing (For Complete Rankings)

- Scheduled jobs (every 5-15 minutes) to recalculate full rankings
- Distributed processing using Apache Spark or similar
- Incremental updates to minimize computation time
- Checkpoint mechanism for fault tolerance

**Processing Flow**:

1. Read score deltas from message queue
2. Apply updates to player score database
3. Identify players whose rank might have changed significantly
4. Recalculate affected ranking ranges
5. Update both hot and warm storage layers
6. Publish ranking change events

### 5. API Gateway and Caching Layer

#### Global API Gateway

- Route requests to nearest regional endpoint
- Rate limiting and authentication
- Request/response caching with intelligent TTL
- Load balancing across multiple backend services

#### Multi-Level Caching Strategy

```
L1: CDN Edge Cache (CloudFlare/AWS CloudFront)
- Cache leaderboard pages for 30-60 seconds
- Geographic distribution for low latency

L2: Application Cache (Redis)
- Cache computed leaderboard segments
- Player rank lookups with 5-10 second TTL

L3: Database Query Cache
- Materialized views for common queries
- Query result caching in database layer
```

## Latency Optimization Strategies

### 1. Geographic Distribution

**Regional Deployment**:

- Deploy complete stacks in major regions (US, EU, Asia)
- Use DNS-based geographic routing
- Regional data replication with master-slave or multi-master setup
- Cross-region communication via dedicated network links

### 2. Predictive Caching

**Smart Cache Warming**:

- Pre-compute leaderboard segments during low-traffic periods
- Cache popular rank ranges (top 100, top 1000, around player's rank)
- Use machine learning to predict which leaderboard segments will be requested
- Implement cache-aside pattern with automatic refresh

### 3. Approximate Rankings for Speed

**Tiered Precision Approach**:

- **Exact rankings** for top 1000 players (updated in real-time)
- **Approximate rankings** for positions 1001-100000 (updated every 5 minutes)
- **Estimated rankings** for remaining players (updated every 15-30 minutes)

This allows most players to see reasonably current rankings while guaranteeing precision where it matters most.

## Data Flow Example

### Score Update Journey

1. **Player Achievement**: Player scores 95,000 points in a match
2. **Game Server Processing**: Regional game server validates and accepts score
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Player sees updated score locally (optimistic update)
4. **Event Publishing**: Score event sent to message queue with player_id, new_score, timestamp
5. **Stream Processing**: Event processed, deduplicated, and validated
6. **Storage Updates**:
    - Hot storage updated if player is in top rankings
    - Warm storage updated with new score record
    - Cold storage scheduled for batch update
7. **Rank Calculation**: Background job determines if player's rank changed significantly
8. **Cache Invalidation**: Relevant cached leaderboard segments invalidated
9. **Global Propagation**: Updates replicated to other regional clusters

### Query Processing Journey

1. **Player Request**: Player requests leaderboard showing ranks 500-600
2. **CDN Check**: CDN serves cached response if available and fresh
3. **API Gateway**: Routes to nearest regional API endpoint
4. **Cache Lookup**: Application cache checked for requested rank range
5. **Database Query**: If cache miss, query warm storage for leaderboard segment
6. **Response Assembly**: Combine player data with ranking information
7. **Cache Update**: Store result in application cache for future requests
8. **Response Delivery**: Send leaderboard data to client

## Consistency and Reliability Patterns

### Eventually Consistent Architecture

The system embraces eventual consistency to achieve high performance while providing mechanisms to handle consistency requirements where needed.

**Consistency Levels**:

- **Strong Consistency**: Top 100 players (critical for competitive integrity)
- **Session Consistency**: Player's own rank and score (consistent within player's session)
- **Eventual Consistency**: General leaderboard positions (acceptable delay of 5-15 minutes)

### Conflict Resolution

When the same player's score is updated simultaneously across regions:

1. **Timestamp-based ordering**: Latest timestamp wins
2. **Vector clocks**: For handling network partition scenarios
3. **Application-level resolution**: Game-specific rules for tie-breaking

### Failure Handling

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascade failures when components are overloaded **Graceful Degradation**: Serve slightly stale data rather than error responses **Automatic Failover**: Switch to backup regions when primary regions fail **Data Replication**: Multi-region backup with automated recovery procedures

## Performance Characteristics

### Expected Latencies

- **Score Update Acknowledgment**: < 50ms (local region)
- **Top 100 Leaderboard Query**: < 100ms (with CDN cache hit: < 20ms)
- **Player Rank Lookup**: < 200ms (with application cache hit: < 50ms)
- **Global Rank Propagation**: 5-15 minutes (eventual consistency)

### Throughput Capabilities

- **Score Updates**: 100,000+ updates per second globally
- **Leaderboard Queries**: 1,000,000+ queries per second globally
- **Concurrent Players**: Support for 10+ million active players

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics

- **Update Latency**: Time from score event to storage persistence
- **Query Response Time**: P95/P99 latencies for different query types
- **Consistency Lag**: Time difference between regional replicas
- **Cache Hit Rates**: Effectiveness of multi-level caching strategy
- **Error Rates**: Failed updates, timeouts, and consistency conflicts

### Alerting Strategy

- **Real-time alerts** for system outages or performance degradation
- **Trend-based alerts** for gradual performance issues
- **Business logic alerts** for suspicious scoring patterns or potential cheating

This architecture provides a robust foundation for a global gaming leaderboard that can scale to millions of users while maintaining the responsiveness that gamers expect. The key is balancing consistency requirements with performance needs through intelligent caching, regional distribution, and tiered precision approaches.

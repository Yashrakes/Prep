Imagine you’re building a system like **Uber**, **Google Maps**, or a nearby restaurant finder.

You need to store and query millions or even billions of location points to find **what's "close" to a specific point?** And you want to do it _fast_.

But querying latitude and longitude ranges can get messy and slow, especially at scale.

That’s where **GeoHashing** comes in.

In this article, we’ll explore:

- What GeoHashing is
    
- How it works
    
- Common use cases
    
- Limitations and trade-offs
    
- Practical System Design Example

# 1. The Problem: Finding Nearby Entities Efficiently

Imagine you have a database table of restaurants, with columns for **latitude** and **longitude**. A user at (**lat: 34.0523, lon: -118.2438**) wants to find all restaurants within a 1km radius.

How would you write this query?

A naive approach might be a "bounding box" query:

This works, but it has major performance problems at scale:

Most databases use **B-tree indexes**, which are fantastic for one-dimensional data. But they struggle with 2D queries. The database can use an index on latitude, but then it has to do a full scan of all matching rows to filter by longitude (or vice-versa).

A **composite index** on (latitude, longitude) helps, but it still doesn't truly understand spatial locality.

We need a way to represent 2D proximity in a 1D format that a standard database index can efficiently search. That’s what **GeoHashing** is about.

# 2. What is GeoHashing?

**GeoHashing** is a method of encoding geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) into a short alphanumeric string.

It was invented by **Gustavo Niemeyer in 2008** as a way to enable efficient spatial indexing and proximity search in databases and distributed systems.

**Example:** The coordinates for downtown **San Francisco** **(37.7749, -122.4194)** can be encoded as the geohash: **9q8yyf**.

This hash looks like just a random string of characters but it has two magical properties:

### 1. Spatial Locality

The more characters two GeoHashes share at the beginning (i.e., the longer their common prefix), the **closer those two locations are geographically**.

This means: **Nearby points** will usually have **similar GeoHash prefixes**. **Far-apart points** will have **completely different prefixes**.

GeoHashes are **hierarchical**: each additional character in the hash zooms in to a more precise region.

#### Example:

- `9q8yyf` and `9q9pvu` share the first **three characters** → they belong to **neighboring regions** but are **not immediately adjacent**.
    
- `9q8yyf` and `9q5ctr` share only the first **two characters** → they are **farther apart**, likely hundreds of kilometers.
    
- `a2sed7` → starts with a **completely different prefix**. It represents a **geographically distant** region, possibly on another continent.
    

### 2. One-Dimensional and Indexable

GeoHashes convert 2D coordinates (latitude, longitude) into a **1D string**. This string can be stored in a **VARCHAR** or **TEXT** field in a relational or NoSQL database, and indexed efficiently using a **B-tree** or **Trie**.

This allows for:

- Fast lookups of nearby places
    
- Easy sharding based on location
    
- Efficient sorting and filtering using standard indexes

# 2. How GeoHashing Works?

GeoHashing may look like magic at first glance, but it’s built on a simple and elegant idea: convert a 2D geographic point into a 1D string through binary encoding and interleaving.

Let’s walk through the process of encoding a `(latitude, longitude)` pair into a GeoHash — step by step.

## Step 1: Define the Initial Ranges

We begin by defining the global bounds of latitude and longitude:

- **Latitude** ranges from **-90° to +90°**
    
- **Longitude** ranges from **-180° to +180°**
    

These represent the full span of the Earth’s surface in both dimensions.

The goal is to gradually **narrow down** this range by encoding whether a coordinate lies in the **lower or upper half** of the current interval, similar to a binary search.

## Step 2: Convert to Binary by Interleaving

Now, we start converting the latitude and longitude into binary.

### Recursive Bisection

We start with the full range of values:

- **Latitude**: `[-90°, +90°]`
    
- **Longitude**: `[-180°, +180°]`
    

We then **repeatedly divide each range in half** and record a binary digit based on which half the coordinate falls into:

- If the value is in the **lower half**, we append a `0`.
    
- If the value is in the **upper half**, we append a `1`.
    

This is a lot like binary search — but instead of just narrowing down to a value, we record each decision as a bit in the final output.

### Interleaving Latitude and Longitude Bits

We don’t encode latitude and longitude separately. We **interleave** their bits:

- 1st bit → longitude
    
- 2nd bit → latitude
    
- 3rd bit → longitude
    
- 4th bit → latitude  
    ... and so on.
    

This interleaving produces a **single binary string** that represents the position in a Morton curve (Z-order curve), which helps preserve spatial locality.

### Example:

Let’s walk through the first few steps for the point: **(37.7749° N, -122.4194° W)**

#### Step 1: Longitude → -122.4194°

Initial range: `[-180°, +180°]`

1. Midpoint = `0` → -122.4194 < 0 → `0` → New range: `[-180, 0]`
    
2. Midpoint = `-90` → -122.4194 < -90 → `0` → New range: `[-180, -90]`
    
3. Midpoint = `-135` → -122.4194 > -135 → `1` → New range: `[-135, -90]`
    
4. Midpoint = `-112.5` → -122.4194 < -112.5 → `0` → New range: `[-135, -112.5]`
    
5. Midpoint = `-123.75` → -122.4194 > -123.75 → `1` → New range: `[-123.75, -112.5]`
    

So first 5 longitude bits = `00101`

#### Step 2: Latitude → 37.7749°

Initial range: `[-90°, +90°]`

1. Midpoint = `0` → 37.7749 > 0 → `1` → New range: `[0, +90]`
    
2. Midpoint = `45` → 37.7749 < 45 → `0` → New range: `[0, 45]`
    
3. Midpoint = `22.5` → 37.7749 > 22.5 → `1` → New range: `[22.5, 45]`
    
4. Midpoint = `33.75` → 37.7749 > 33.75 → `1` → New range: `[33.75, 45]`
    
5. Midpoint = `39.375` → 37.7749 < 39.375 → `0` → New range: `[33.75, 39.375]`
    

First 5 latitude bits = `10110`

#### Step 3: Interleave the Bits

Interleaving the two binary sequences:

```
Longitude bits:  0 0 1 0 1  
Latitude bits:   1 0 1 1 0  

Interleaved:     0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
```

Resulting binary string (10 bits): `0100111010`

#### Step 4: Continue Until You Reach Desired Precision

You typically continue this process until you have:

- **30 bits** → 6-character GeoHash
    
- **35 bits** → 7-character GeoHash
    
- **60+ bits** → very high precision
    

## Step 3: Convert Binary to Base32 String

Once we’ve built a long binary string by interleaving latitude and longitude bits, we need to **compress it into something shorter and human-readable.**

This is where **Base32 encoding** comes in.

- Take the interleaved binary string and split it into **5-bit chunks**.
    
- Convert each 5-bit chunk into a Base32 character.
    

#### Base32 Alphabet Used in GeoHashing:

```
0123456789bcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyz
```

> Note: The letters `a`, `i`, `l`, and `o` are intentionally omitted to avoid confusion with similar-looking digits or letters (`1`, `0`, etc.).

This step compresses a potentially long binary string into a **short alphanumeric hash**, usually between **5 to 12 characters**, depending on the desired precision.

### Example:

Let’s say your interleaved binary string is:

```
01001 11010 10011 00101
```

Break it into 5-bit groups and convert each chunk into a Base32 character:

- `01001` → 9
    
- `11010` → u
    
- `10011` → r
    
- `00101` → 5
    

Final GeoHash: `9ur5`

### Precision vs. Length

Each additional character in the GeoHash increases the precision of the location.

You can **control the granularity** of your spatial encoding just by adjusting the number.

# 3. Why Use GeoHashing?

GeoHashing offers benefits that are highly valuable in location-based services:

#### Efficient Proximity Search

Instead of range queries on lat/lon, you can:

- Use GeoHash prefix matching
    
- Search within a bounding box by comparing string prefixes
    

#### Indexing in Databases

Databases like PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and MongoDB can:

- Index strings faster than floating-point pairs
    
- Use trie or B-tree-based lookups for prefix search
    

#### Spatial Sharding

GeoHashes are great for sharding data in distributed systems:

- Assign prefixes to different servers/partitions
    
- Keep nearby data close together
    

---

# 4. Real-World Applications

GeoHashing is widely used in location-based apps and geospatial databases.

Here are some real-world examples where GeoHashing shines:

#### Ridesharing Platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft)

GeoHashes can be used to group drivers and riders into **spatial buckets** based on their current location.

- When a rider requests a trip, the system calculates their GeoHash (e.g., to 6 or 7 characters).
    
- It then quickly finds drivers in the **same or neighboring GeoHash cells**, drastically reducing the search space.
    
- This enables **real-time proximity matching** without scanning all active drivers.
    

#### Food Delivery Services (e.g., Swiggy, Zomato)

When a user opens the app to browse nearby restaurants:

- Their coordinates are converted into a GeoHash.
    
- The backend queries all restaurants whose stored GeoHashes **match that prefix** or its neighbors.
    
- This allows the system to serve relevant results **instantly**, even with millions of entries in the database.
    

#### Geospatial Databases (e.g., Elasticsearch, MongoDB)

GeoHashing is often used under the hood in spatial indexing strategies.

- **Elasticsearch** supports `geohash_grid` aggregations to efficiently bucket documents by location.
    
- **MongoDB** can store GeoHashes for fast, prefix-based querying on 2D location fields.

# 5. Limitations and Trade-offs

GeoHashing is a powerful tool for spatial indexing but like any abstraction, it comes with trade-offs.

### Advantages

- **Simplicity:** It maps a 2D problem to a 1D problem, allowing for extremely fast prefix searches on standard database indexes.
    
- **Hierarchical:** You can easily "zoom in" or "zoom out" by simply adjusting the length of the geohash string you use for querying. This is great for map UIs.
    
- **Scalable:** It scales horizontally very well. The workload is easily distributable.
    
- **Database Agnostic:** It works with any database that supports string indexing (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
    

### Disadvantages

- **The Edge Case Problem:** You must query neighboring cells to avoid missing nearby points that fall across a boundary. This adds a little complexity to the query logic.
    
- **Cell Shape Distortion:** Geohash cells are rectangular, and their shape distorts and becomes less square-like as you move away from the equator. This means a geohash doesn't represent a uniform circular area.
    
- **False Positives:** Two points can be in the same geohash cell but at opposite corners, making them farther apart than a point in a neighboring cell. This is why the final, precise distance calculation is necessary.
    
- **Not a True k-NN:** On its own, geohashing is a proximity search, not a true "k-Nearest Neighbors" search. You must combine it with a post-filtering distance calculation to get accurate k-NN results.

# 6. Using GeoHashing in a System Design

Now let’s look at how to **practically implement GeoHashing** to build a location-based feature like showing nearby restaurants.

### 1. Indexing the Data

Let's say we have a **restaurants** table in our database.

To enable fast geospatial queries:

- We add a new column called `geohash`.
    
- Every time a restaurant is created or its location is updated, we:
    
    - Calculate its GeoHash (e.g., with **7-character precision**).
        
    - Store it in the `geohash` column.
        

This prepares the data for **efficient prefix-based lookups**.

**Schema Example:**

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uPRf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ccac42d-69a7-48e7-b52a-65a3a767f90b_2548x1228.png)

Since GeoHash is stored as a string, we can index it with a **B-tree** which enables fast, lexicographical prefix filtering.

### 2. Querying for Nearby Items

Let's say a user is at a location that maps to GeoHash: `dr5ruj6`.

To find nearby restaurants within, say, a **200-meter radius**, the most basic query would be:

[

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VUes!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdca48836-838b-4d74-997f-b843a86c0fc6_2332x508.png)



](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VUes!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdca48836-838b-4d74-997f-b843a86c0fc6_2332x508.png)

This works well in many cases, but there's a **critical flaw**.

#### The Edge Case Problem

What if the user is standing **right on the edge** of the `dr5ruj6` cell, and the closest restaurant is just **across the boundary** in a neighboring cell like `dr5ruj7`?

The query above would **miss** that restaurant even though it may be just 20 meters away.

### 3. The Solution: Include Neighboring Cells

Each GeoHash defines a bounding box. If we also consider the 8 immediate neighbors around that box, we cover **the full surrounding area**, eliminating blind spots at cell edges.

#### Full Query Strategy:

1. **Get User Location:** Capture user's current latitude and longitude.
    
2. **Calculate Base Geohash:** Convert that location to a GeoHash with your chosen precision (e.g., `dr5ruj6`).
    
3. **Calculate Neighbors:** Use a GeoHash utility/library to get the 8 surrounding GeoHashes.
    
4. **Query all 9 cells:** Query the database for items whose geohash starts with _any_ of these 9 prefixes (the user's cell + 8 neighbors).

    ](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q_eM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff18b1fc8-4d29-4f16-b877-e1437e4754a5_2080x1316.png)
    

### 4. Post-Filtering

The GeoHash-based prefix query is **fast**, but still slightly approximate.

So once we get the **candidate set of restaurants**, we do a second, more precise filtering step:

- Use the **Haversine formula** or **Vincenty formula** to compute the **exact distance** between the user’s location and each candidate.
    
- **Filter out** any restaurants that fall **outside** the desired radius (e.g., beyond 200m).
    
- **Sort** the remaining results by distance to return the nearest ones first.
    

> The expensive Haversine computation is done on **hundreds** of rows, not **millions**, which keeps the system performant.

---

# 7. Alternatives to GeoHashing

While **GeoHashing** is a fast, lightweight, and scalable approach to spatial indexing, it's not the only option.

Several other data structures are commonly used in geospatial systems, each with their own strengths and trade-offs:

### Quadtrees / K-d Trees

These are **tree-based spatial partitioning structures** that recursively divide the space into smaller regions.

- **Quadtrees** divide 2D space into four quadrants at each level.
    
- **K-d Trees** divide k-dimensional space by alternating splitting axes (e.g., latitude and longitude).
    

GeoHashing can be conceptually seen as a simplified, linearized representation of a **quadtree traversal**, following a space-filling curve like a Z-order (Morton) curve.

### R-trees

**R-trees** are commonly used in spatial databases such as **PostGIS** (PostgreSQL extension), **Oracle Spatial**, and **SQLite’s SpatiaLite**.

- They group nearby objects into **bounding rectangles**.
    
- Each node in the tree contains the **minimum bounding rectangle (MBR)** that encloses its children.
    
- This structure supports efficient queries for containment, intersection, and nearest neighbors.

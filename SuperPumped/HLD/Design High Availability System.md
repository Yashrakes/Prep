# High Availability System Design: Active-Passive vs Active-Active Architectures
## 1. Introduction to High Availability
- **Definition**: High Availability (HA) refers to systems designed to operate continuously without failure for extended periods by eliminating single points of failure.
- **Importance**: Critical for applications where downtime means significant business impact (financial systems, e-commerce, healthcare).
- **Key Metrics**:
    - **Uptime**: Measured in "nines" (99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%)
    - **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable time to restore service after failure
    - **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss during recovery

## 2. Active-Passive Architecture
### Core Concept
- An Active-Passive architecture consists of two or more systems where only one (the "active" node) processes requests while the others (the "passive" or "standby" nodes) remain idle, ready to take over if the active node fails.

### Components and Workflow
1. **Active Node**: Handles all production traffic and workload
2. **Passive Node(s)**: Mirrors the active node but doesn't process requests
3. **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Monitors active node health
4. **Data Replication**: Keeps passive nodes in sync with active node
5. **Failover Process**: Automatically promotes passive node when active node fails

### Implementation Methods
- **Cold Standby**: Passive system is available but not running until needed
- **Warm Standby**: Passive system runs in the background, partially ready
- **Hot Standby**: Passive system runs continuously, fully synchronized and ready for immediate takeover

### Real-World Examples
- **Database Systems**: Oracle Data Guard, PostgreSQL streaming replication
- **Network Infrastructure**: Cisco HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
- **Storage Systems**: EMC SRDF (Symmetrix Remote Data Facility)
- **Legacy Enterprise Applications**: Many traditional ERP systems

## 3. Active-Active Architecture
### Core Concept
- An Active-Active architecture consists of multiple nodes, all simultaneously processing requests, providing both redundancy and load distribution.

### Components and Workflow
1. **Multiple Active Nodes**: All nodes process requests concurrently
2. **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across all active nodes
3. **State Synchronization**: Maintains consistent state across nodes
4. **Distributed Data Store**: Ensures data consistency across nodes
5. **Health Monitoring**: Detects node failures and redistributes load

### Implementation Methods
- **Stateless Applications**: Easiest to implement in active-active (web servers)
- **Session Replication**: For maintaining user sessions across nodes
- **Distributed Caching**: To share application state (Redis, Memcached)
- **Multi-Master Databases**: For data consistency (Galera Cluster, DynamoDB)

### Real-World Examples
- **Web Applications**: Netflix, Amazon's product catalog
- **CDNs**: Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly
- **DNS Services**: Route 53, Cloudflare DNS
- **Modern Cloud Databases**: Google Spanner, Amazon Aurora, CockroachDB

# Potential Interview Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is the main difference between Active-Passive and Active-Active architectures?**
- A: The fundamental difference is in how nodes handle production workloads. In Active-Passive, only one node (the active node) processes requests while others remain on standby, taking over only if the active node fails. In Active-Active, all nodes simultaneously process requests, providing both redundancy and load distribution. Active-Passive offers simpler data consistency but less efficient resource utilization, while Active-Active provides better performance and utilization but with increased complexity for state synchronization.
---
**Q2: How would you calculate the availability of a system?**
- A: Availability is typically calculated as a percentage of uptime over a given period:
- Availability = (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time Ã— 100%
- For example, 99.99% availability ("four nines") translates to approximately 52.6 minutes of downtime per year. For complex systems with multiple components, we calculate combined availability by multiplying the availability of each component in series, or using more complex formulas for components in parallel with redundancy.
---
**Q3: Explain the concept of "split-brain" and how to prevent it.**
A: Split-brain occurs when nodes in a high availability cluster lose communication with each other but continue operating independently, potentially causing data inconsistencies or corruption. To prevent it:
1. Implement quorum-based decision making, where a majority of nodes must agree before important decisions
2. Use fencing mechanisms to forcibly shut down the isolated node
3. Employ a third-party arbitrator (like a witness server) to break ties
4. Implement proper timeout settings to distinguish between network failures and node failures
5. Use dedicated heartbeat networks separate from production traffic
---
## Architecture Design Questions

**Q4: Design a highly available database system. What architecture would you choose and why?**
- A: For a critical database system with strict consistency requirements, I'd recommend an Active-Passive architecture with hot standby:
	1. Primary database node handling all read-write operations
	2. One or more standby nodes with synchronous replication for zero data loss
	3. Additional asynchronous replicas for read scaling and backup
	4. Automatic failover mechanism with proper fencing
	5. Regular automated failover testing
- This approach provides:
	- Strong data consistency (avoiding multi-master conflicts)
	- Zero or minimal data loss during failover (RPO near zero)
	- Read scaling through replicas
	- Clear upgrade path by rotating through replicas
- For applications that can tolerate eventual consistency, an Active-Active approach with distributed databases might be preferable for better performance and geographic distribution.
---
**Q5: How would you design a highly available web application architecture?**
- A: For a web application, I'd typically choose an Active-Active architecture:
	1. Stateless web servers across multiple availability zones/regions
	2. Load balancers distributing traffic with health checks
	3. Session state stored in distributed cache (Redis/Memcached)
	4. Data tier with appropriate replication strategy
	5. CDN for static content distribution
	6. DNS-level failover for multi-region resilience
- This design offers:
	- Zero downtime during individual component failures
	- Horizontal scalability to handle traffic spikes
	- Geographic distribution for lower latency
	- Graceful degradation capabilities
- For the database tier, I might choose either Active-Active with eventual consistency or Active-Passive with fast failover, depending on the application's specific consistency requirements.

## Implementation Questions

**Q6: What are the key components needed to implement an Active-Passive architecture?**
A: To implement an effective Active-Passive architecture, you need:
1. Reliable health monitoring system that quickly detects failures
2. Data replication mechanism appropriate to your application (synchronous/asynchronous)
3. Automated failover controller that promotes the passive node
4. Network routing or load balancer reconfiguration capability
5. Fencing mechanism to prevent split-brain scenarios
6. Consistent state replication to ensure the passive node is ready
7. Regular testing procedures to verify failover functionality
8. Monitoring and alerting to notify operators of failover events
9. Documented failback procedures for returning to normal operation
---
**Q7: How would you handle data consistency in an Active-Active architecture?**
A: Data consistency in Active-Active architectures requires careful design:
1. For read-heavy workloads, implement cache coherence protocols and time-based invalidation
2. For write operations, consider:
    - Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for automatic conflict resolution
    - Vector clocks or logical timestamps to establish operation ordering
    - Last-writer-wins policies for simple cases
    - Domain-specific conflict resolution for complex business logic
3. Use distributed consensus algorithms (Paxos, Raft) for critical operations
4. Consider eventual consistency where appropriate, with clear boundaries
5. Implement proper transaction isolation levels
6. Use database systems designed for distributed operation (CockroachDB, Google Spanner)
7. Apply event sourcing patterns to maintain audit trails of all state changes
---
## Troubleshooting and Operations Questions
**Q8: Your Active-Passive system has just experienced an unexpected failover. What steps would you take to investigate and address the issue?**
A: I would follow a systematic approach:
1. Verify the failover completed successfully and the system is operational
2. Check monitoring systems to identify the trigger for failover (hardware failure, network issue, resource exhaustion)
3. Isolate the failed active node to prevent it from coming back online prematurely
4. Analyze logs from before the failure for warning signs
5. Determine if it was a false positive failover or a legitimate failure
6. Address the root cause on the original active node
7. Once fixed, test the node thoroughly before attempting failback
8. Schedule a controlled failback during a low-traffic period
9. Update runbooks/documentation with lessons learned
10. Review monitoring thresholds and failover criteria if necessary
---
**Q9: How would you test the failover capability of your high availability system?**
A: Thorough testing is crucial for HA systems:
1. Regular scheduled testing in a staging environment that mirrors production
2. Chaos engineering practices like randomly terminating instances
3. Simulating various failure modes:
    - Hard failures (power loss, hardware failure)
    - Soft failures (service crashes, resource exhaustion)
    - Network partitions and latency issues
    - Database corruption scenarios
4. Measuring actual RTO and RPO during tests
5. Gradually introducing testing in production environments:
    - Starting with less critical components
    - Testing during maintenance windows
    - Eventually implementing regular automated resilience testing
6. Documenting test results and improving procedures based on findings
7. Testing failback procedures as well as failover

## üîë Core Concepts

1. **Data Model**
    
    - **Tables** ‚Üí Like in RDBMS, but without fixed schema.
        
    - **Items** ‚Üí Equivalent to rows; each item is a collection of key-value pairs.
        
    - **Attributes** ‚Üí Equivalent to columns, but flexible (each item can have different attributes).
        
    - **Primary Key** ‚Üí Mandatory; uniquely identifies each item.
        
        - **Partition Key only (simple primary key)**
            
        - **Partition Key + Sort Key (composite primary key)**
            
2. **Indexes**
    
    - **Primary Index** (always exists): Based on table‚Äôs partition + optional sort key.
        
    - **Local Secondary Index (LSI)**: Same partition key as table but different sort key.
        
    - **Global Secondary Index (GSI)**: Different partition + sort key (flexible querying).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How DynamoDB Works Internally

1. **Partitioning (Data Distribution)**
    
    - Every item‚Äôs partition key is hashed.
        
    - That hash decides which **partition (physical storage node)** the item goes to.
        
    - Partitions are spread across multiple servers for scalability.
        
    - Hot partitions can occur if partition keys are not well-distributed.
        
2. **Storage Engine**
    
    - Data is stored across **SSD-backed storage** with replication across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
        
    - Ensures durability & high availability.
        
    - Data is eventually consistent by default, but you can request strong consistency (within the same region).
        
3. **Read/Write Model**
    
    - **WCU (Write Capacity Units)** ‚Üí Throughput for writes.
        
    - **RCU (Read Capacity Units)** ‚Üí Throughput for reads.
        
    - **On-Demand Mode** ‚Üí You don‚Äôt pre-allocate RCUs/WCUs, pay per request.
        
    - **Provisioned Mode** ‚Üí You reserve a certain throughput capacity.
        
4. **Consistency**
    
    - **Eventually Consistent Reads** ‚Üí Fast, may not reflect the latest write immediately.
        
    - **Strongly Consistent Reads** ‚Üí Always reflect the latest write (but can have slightly higher latency).
        
5. **Indexes & Querying**
    
    - You can only query efficiently by partition key (and sort key range).
        
    - For other access patterns, you need GSIs/LSIs.
        
    - Supports `Scan` (full table scan, costly) and `Query` (efficient, by key).
        
6. **Caching**
    
    - Optionally integrate with **DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)** for in-memory caching, reducing read latency from ms ‚Üí microseconds.

## üîÑ Write Path

1. Client sends a `PutItem` or `UpdateItem`.
    
2. DynamoDB hashes the partition key ‚Üí finds partition.
    
3. The request goes through a **replication log (commit log)**.
    
4. Written to **3 AZs** before confirming success.
    
5. Optionally streams the change to **DynamoDB Streams** (for event-driven processing).
    

---

## üìñ Read Path

1. Client issues `GetItem` / `Query`.
    
2. Partition key is hashed ‚Üí correct partition is located.
    
3. Data is fetched from the replica (eventually consistent) or the leader (strong consistent).
    
4. If DAX is enabled, data might be served directly from cache.

## ‚ú® Strengths

- Fully managed (no server ops).
    
- Scales to millions of requests/sec.
    
- High availability (multi-AZ replication).
    
- Predictable low latency.
    

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Limited querying (only via keys or indexes).
    
- Expensive for scans & large analytics workloads.
    
- Hot partition issue if partition keys are not well-distributed.

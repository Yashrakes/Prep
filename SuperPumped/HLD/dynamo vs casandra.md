how deos casandra and dynamo db look like for same use case , give me table and column

###### ChatGPT said:

üî• Great question ‚Äî let‚Äôs compare **how the same use case would be modeled in DynamoDB vs Cassandra**.

We‚Äôll take a **social media app (like Instagram)** as the use case.  
We‚Äôll design the **Users** and **Posts** tables in **both DynamoDB and Cassandra** side by side.

---

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Users Table**

### DynamoDB

- **Primary Key** ‚Üí `user_id` (Partition Key)
    
- **Global Secondary Indexes**:
    
    - GSI1 ‚Üí `username`
        
    - GSI2 ‚Üí `email`
        

`{   "TableName": "Users",   "PrimaryKey": "user_id",   "Attributes": {     "user_id": "uuid-123",     "username": "yash_agarwal",     "email": "yash@example.com",     "name": "Yash Agarwal",     "bio": "Love coding ‚òï",     "followers": 1520,     "following": 230,     "created_at": "2025-09-09T10:30:00Z"   },   "Indexes": {     "GSI1": "username",     "GSI2": "email"   } }`

üëâ In DynamoDB, everything is an **item** with key-value pairs. Queries require partition key (or GSIs).

---

### Cassandra

- **Primary Key** ‚Üí `(user_id)`
    
- Schema is more structured.
    

`CREATE TABLE users (    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,    username TEXT,    email TEXT,    name TEXT,    bio TEXT,    followers INT,    following INT,    created_at TIMESTAMP );`

üëâ In Cassandra, **indexes** are possible but discouraged (performance issues). Instead, you‚Äôd create a **Materialized View** or a **separate table** for `username ‚Üí user_id` and `email ‚Üí user_id`.

---

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Posts Table**

### DynamoDB

- **Partition Key** ‚Üí `user_id`
    
- **Sort Key** ‚Üí `post_time` (to fetch posts in order)
    
- Attributes:
    
    `{   "TableName": "Posts",   "PrimaryKey": {     "PartitionKey": "user_id",     "SortKey": "post_time"   },   "Attributes": {     "post_id": "uuid-567",     "content": "Hello World!",     "likes": 200,     "comments": 50,     "media_url": "s3://bucket/photo.png"   } }`
    

üëâ In DynamoDB, queries look like:

`Query("user_id" = "uuid-123")  ORDER BY post_time DESC`

---

### Cassandra

- Partition by `user_id`
    
- Cluster by `post_time` (descending order)
    

`CREATE TABLE posts (    user_id UUID,    post_time TIMESTAMP,    post_id UUID,    content TEXT,    likes INT,    comments INT,    media_url TEXT,    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, post_time) ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (post_time DESC);`

üëâ In Cassandra, queries look like:

`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = uuid-123 ORDER BY post_time DESC;`

---

# üîë Key Difference in Schema Thinking

|Feature|DynamoDB|Cassandra|
|---|---|---|
|Data Model|Key-Value / Document|Wide-Column|
|Users|Single `Users` table with GSIs for username/email|`users` table + extra tables/views for username/email lookup|
|Posts|One table: `Posts` with (PartitionKey = user_id, SortKey = post_time)|One table: `posts` with (PartitionKey = user_id, ClusteringKey = post_time)|
|Indexing|GSIs / LSIs (built-in)|Secondary Indexes (limited), Materialized Views, or separate tables|
|Schema|Schema-less (flexible attributes per item)|Schema-based (fixed columns per row)|

---

‚úÖ **Summary**:

- **DynamoDB** ‚Üí schema-less, flexible, access-pattern-first design, heavy use of GSIs.
    
- **Cassandra** ‚Üí schema-based, query-driven design, partition + clustering keys are the core, often denormalize into multiple tables.




how is dynamo db different then casandra

###### ChatGPT said:

Great question üëç DynamoDB and Cassandra are often compared because both are **NoSQL, distributed, partitioned, highly available databases**, but they differ in **ownership, architecture, and trade-offs**. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

# ‚öñÔ∏è DynamoDB vs Cassandra

## 1. **Ownership & Management**

- **DynamoDB**:
    
    - Proprietary, fully managed service by AWS.
        
    - You don‚Äôt manage nodes, scaling, replication ‚Äì AWS handles it.
        
    - Pay-per-request (on-demand) or provisioned capacity billing.
        
- **Cassandra**:
    
    - Open-source (Apache Cassandra), community-driven.
        
    - Self-managed ‚Üí you‚Äôre responsible for scaling, replication, node management.
        
    - Free to use, but infra + ops cost you.
        
    - Managed Cassandra services exist (e.g., DataStax Astra, AWS Keyspaces).
        

---

## 2. **Data Model**

- **DynamoDB**:
    
    - Key-Value + Document model.
        
    - Table ‚Üí Item ‚Üí Attribute.
        
    - Must design schema around **access patterns first**.
        
    - Flexible schema (each item can have different attributes).
        
- **Cassandra**:
    
    - Wide-Column Store.
        
    - Table ‚Üí Row (partitioned by key) ‚Üí Columns.
        
    - Rows with the same partition key are clustered by clustering columns (sort key-like).
        
    - Schema is more structured than DynamoDB.
        

---

## 3. **Partitioning & Distribution**

- **DynamoDB**:
    
    - Uses **partition key hashing** to distribute data across partitions.
        
    - AWS auto-manages re-sharding & scaling.
        
    - You only worry about choosing a **good partition key**.
        
- **Cassandra**:
    
    - Uses **consistent hashing (Murmur3)** to map partitions to nodes.
        
    - You control cluster size, replication factor, and consistency.
        
    - You must manage **token ranges, repair, and rebalancing**.
        

---

## 4. **Consistency Model**

- **DynamoDB**:
    
    - **Eventually Consistent Reads** (default).
        
    - **Strongly Consistent Reads** (optional, same region only).
        
    - Single-region or multi-region replication is automatic if enabled.
        
- **Cassandra**:
    
    - **Tunable Consistency**: you can configure per query:
        
        - `ONE` (fast, less durable)
            
        - `QUORUM` (balanced)
            
        - `ALL` (strong consistency, slower)
            
    - Multi-DC replication configurable with different consistency levels.
        

---

## 5. **Scaling**

- **DynamoDB**:
    
    - Auto-scales read/write throughput.
        
    - Can handle millions of requests/sec without ops effort.
        
    - But you pay for provisioned RCUs/WCUs or per request (on-demand).
        
- **Cassandra**:
    
    - Scales horizontally by adding more nodes.
        
    - Linear scalability, but **requires ops expertise** to rebalance, repair, and monitor clusters.
        
    - More flexible for **self-hosted multi-region clusters**.
        

---

## 6. **Indexes & Querying**

- **DynamoDB**:
    
    - Native query limited to **partition key (and sort key ranges)**.
        
    - For other queries: use **Global Secondary Index (GSI)** or **Local Secondary Index (LSI)**.
        
    - Doesn‚Äôt support ad-hoc queries (no joins, no aggregations).
        
- **Cassandra**:
    
    - Can query by **partition key + clustering columns** efficiently.
        
    - Supports **secondary indexes** and **materialized views**, but with limitations.
        
    - Query flexibility is better than DynamoDB, but still constrained vs SQL.
        

---

## 7. **Performance**

- **DynamoDB**:
    
    - Consistently low latency (~ single-digit ms).
        
    - DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator) ‚Üí microsecond caching.
        
- **Cassandra**:
    
    - Low latency (~ ms) when tuned properly.
        
    - Performance depends on cluster health, compaction, and partitioning strategy.
        

---

## 8. **Cost Model**

- **DynamoDB**:
    
    - Pay for what you use:
        
        - **On-demand mode** (per request).
            
        - **Provisioned mode** (fixed RCUs/WCUs).
            
    - Storage cost + read/write cost + extra for Streams, backups, DAX.
        
    - Can get expensive for high-volume workloads.
        
- **Cassandra**:
    
    - Open-source = no license cost.
        
    - You pay for servers, storage, networking.
        
    - Cheaper at extreme scale if you have infra + ops expertise.
        
    - Managed Cassandra (Astra, AWS Keyspaces) has its own pricing.
        

---

## 9. **Use Cases**

- **DynamoDB**:
    
    - AWS-first apps (serverless, Lambda, API Gateway).
        
    - High-throughput, low-latency workloads.
        
    - Examples: gaming leaderboards, IoT data, shopping carts, user sessions.
        
- **Cassandra**:
    
    - Multi-cloud or on-prem workloads.
        
    - Event logging, time-series data, IoT at scale.
        
    - Telecom, banking, recommendation engines, analytics pipelines.

# DNS
There are four key components, or a group of servers, that make up the DNS infrastructure. These are:

-   _DNS Recursive nameserver aka DNS Resolver_
-   _Root nameserver_
-   _Top-Level Domain nameserver_
-   _Authoritative nameserver_

## Process

- So, when the user hits enter after typing in the _domain name_ into their browser, the browser sends a request to the _DNS Recursive nameserver_, also known as the _DNS Resolver_.

- The role of _DNS Resolver_ is to receive the client request and forward it to the _Root nameserver_ to get the address of the _Top-Level domain nameserver_.

- The _DNS Recursive nameserver_ is generally managed by our _ISP Internet service provider_. The whole _DNS_ system is a distributed system setup in large data centers managed by internet service providers.

- These data centers contain clusters of servers that are optimized to process _DNS queries_ in minimal time that is in milliseconds.

- So, once the _DNS Resolver_ forwards the request to the _Root nameserver_, the _Root nameserver_ returns the address of the _Top-Level domain nameserver_ in response. As an example, the top-level domain for _[amazon.com](http://amazon.com/)_ is _.com_.

- Once the _DNS Resolver_ receives the address of the _top-level domain nameserver_, it sends a request to it to fetch the details of the domain name. _Top Level domain nameservers_ hold the data for domains using their top-level domains.

- For instance, _.com_ top-level domain nameserver will contain information on domains using _.com_. Similarly, a _.edu_ Top-Level domain nameserver will hold information on domains using _.edu_.

- Since our domain is _[amazon.com](http://amazon.com/)_, the _DNS Resolver_ will route the request to the _.com_ top-level domain name server.

- Once the _top-level domain name server_ receives the request from the _Resolver_, it returns the _IP address_ of _[amazon.com](http://amazon.com/)_ domain name server.

- _[amazon.com](http://amazon.com/)_ domain nameserver is the last server in the _DNS query lookup process_. The nameserver is responsible for _[amazon.com](http://amazon.com/)_ domain and is also known as the _Authoritative nameserver_. This nameserver is owned by the owner of the domain name.

- Then, DNS Resolver fires a query to the _Authoritative nameserver_, and it returns the _IP address_ of _[amazon.com](http://amazon.com/)_ website to the _DNS Resolver_. _DNS Resolver_ caches the data and forwards it to the client.

- On receiving the response, the browser sends a request to _[amazon.com](http://amazon.com/)_ website’s IP address to fetch data from their servers.

- Often all this _DNS_ information is cached, and the DNS servers don’t have to do so much rerouting every time a client requests an _IP_ of a certain website.

- The _DNS_ information of websites that we visit also gets cached in our local machines, that is our browsing devices with a _TTL Time To Live_.

- All modern browsers do this automatically to cut down the _DNS query lookup time_ when revisiting a website.

This is how the entire DNS query lookup process works.

# Achieving High Availability - Fault Tolerance

There are several approaches to achieve HA. The most important of them is to make the system fault tolerant.

## What is fault tolerance?

> _Fault tolerance_ is a system’s ability to stay up despite taking hits.

- A fault-tolerant system is equipped to handle faults. Being fault-tolerant is an essential element in designing life-critical systems.

- Out of several _instances/node_, running the service, a few go offline and bounce back all the time. In case of these internal failures, the system can work at a reduced level without, going down entirely.

- A very basic example of a system that is fault-tolerant is a social networking application. In the case of backend node failures, a few services of the app such as image upload, post likes etc. may stop working. However, the application as a whole will still be up. This approach is also technically known as _fail soft_.

## Designing a highly available fault-tolerant service – Architecture

To achieve high availability at the application level, the entire massive service is architecturally broken down into smaller loosely coupled services called **micro services**.

There are many upsides of splitting a big monolith into several micro services, as it provides:

-   Easier management
-   Easier development
-   Ease of adding new features
-   Ease of maintenance
-   High availability

Every micro service takes the onus of running different features of an application such as image upload, comment, instant messaging etc.

So, even if a few services go down the application as a whole is still up.

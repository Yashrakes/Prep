# High Availability Clustering

- In this lesson, you will cover high availability clustering.

- Now that you have a clear understanding of high availability, letâ€™s talk a bit about the high-availability cluster.

- A _high availability cluster_ also known as the _fail-over cluster_, contains a set of nodes running in conjunction with each other that ensures high availability of the service.

- The nodes in the cluster are connected by a private network called the _heartbeat network_ that continuously monitors the health and the status of each node in the cluster.

- A single state across all the nodes in a cluster is achieved with the help of a shared distributed memory and a distributed coordination service like the _Zookeeper_.

- To ensure the availability, HA clusters use several techniques such as _disk mirroring/Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)_, redundant network connections, redundant electrical power etc. The network connections are made redundant. So, if the primary network goes down the backup network takes over.

- Multiple HA clusters run together in one geographical zone ensuring minimum downtime and continual service.

- Alright, so now we have a pretty good understanding of scalability and high availability. These two concepts are crucial to software system design.

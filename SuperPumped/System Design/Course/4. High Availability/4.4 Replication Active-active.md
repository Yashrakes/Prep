## Replication – Active-active HA mode

- Replication means having a number of similar nodes running the workload together. There are no standby or passive instances. When a single or a few nodes go down, the remaining nodes bear the load of the service. Think of this as load balancing.

- This approach is also known as the _active-active high availability_ mode. In this approach, all the components of the system are active at any point in time.

- In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.

- If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers. If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.

- Active-active failover can also be referred to as `master-master failover.`

## Geographical distribution of workload

- As a contingency for natural disasters, regional power outages, and other big-scale failures, data center workloads are spread across different data centers across the world in different geographical zones.

- This avoids the single point of failure in the context of a data center. Also, the latency is reduced by quite an extent due to the proximity of data to the user.

- All highly available fault-tolerant design decisions are subjective to how critical the system is. Designers must ask “what are the odds that the components will fail”?

- Businesses often use multi-cloud platforms to deploy their workloads which ensures further availability. If things go south with one cloud provider, they have another to fail back over.

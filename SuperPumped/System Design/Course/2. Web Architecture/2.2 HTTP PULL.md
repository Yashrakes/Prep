## HTTP Pull - Polling with AJAX


- There are two ways of pulling/fetching data from the server.

- The first is sending an _HTTP GET_ request to the server manually by triggering an event by clicking a button or any other element on the web page.

- The other is fetching data dynamically at regular intervals by using _AJAX_ without any human intervention.


> _AJAX_ stands for asynchronous _JavaScript_ and _XML_. The name says it all. AJAX is used for adding asynchronous behavior to the web page.

- As you can see in the illustration above, instead of requesting the data manually every time with the click of a button. AJAX enables us to fetch the updated data from the server by automatically sending the requests over and over at stipulated intervals.

- Upon receiving the updates, a particular section of the web page is updated dynamically by the _callback_ method. We see this behavior all the time on news and sports websites, where the updated event information is dynamically displayed on the page without needing to reload it.

- AJAX uses an _XMLHttpRequest_ object for sending the requests to the server which is built-in the browser and uses JavaScript to update the _HTML DOM_.

- AJAX is commonly used with the _jQuery_ framework to implement the asynchronous behavior on the UI.

- This dynamic technique of requesting information from the server after regular intervals is known as _polling_.

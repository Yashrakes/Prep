## What Is polyglot persistence?

> _Polyglot persistence_ means using several different persistence technologies to fulfil different persistence requirements in an application.

We will discuss this concept with the help of an example.

## Real-world use case

Let’s say we are designing a social network like Facebook.

## Relational database

To store relationships like persisting friends of a user, friends of friends, what rock band user likes, what food preferences users have in common with friends, etc., we would pick a relational database like _MySQL_.

## Key Value Store

For low latency access of all the frequently accessed data, we will implement a cache using a _Key-value_ store like _Redis_ or _Memcached_.

We can use the same _Key-value_ data store to store user _sessions_.

Now, our app is already a big hit. It has gotten pretty popular, and we have millions of active users.

## Wide column database

To understand user behavior, we need to set up an analytics system to run analytics on the data generated by the users. We can do this using a _wide-column_ database like _Cassandra_ or _HBase_.

## ACID transactions and strong consistency

The popularity of our application just doesn’t seem to stop, it’s soaring. Now businesses want to run ads on our portal. For this, we need to set up a payment system.

Again, we would pick a _relational database_ to implement _ACID transactions_ and ensure _strong consistency_.

## Graph database

Now to enhance our application’s user experience, we have to start recommending content to the users to keep them engaged. A _graph database_ would fit best to implement a recommendation system.

Alright, by now, our application has multiple features, and everyone loves it. How cool would it be if a user could run a search for other users, business pages, and what not on our portal and connect with them?

## Document Oriented Store

To implement this, we can use an open-source _document-oriented_ datastore like _Elasticsearch_. The product is pretty popular in the industry for implementing a scalable search feature on websites. We can persist all the search-related data in the elastic store.

## Downside of this approach

So, this is how we use multiple databases to fulfil different persistence requirements. However, one downside of this approach is the increased complexity required to make all these different technologies work together.

A lot of effort goes into building, managing and monitoring polyglot persistence systems. What if there was something simpler? That would save us the pain of putting together everything ourselves. Well, there is.

# What is Monolithic Architecture ?

- A monolithic application is a self-contained, single-tiered software application. This is unlike the microservices architecture, where different modules are responsible for running respective tasks and features of an app.

- In a monolithic web app, all the different layers of the app, UI, business, data access, etc., are in the same codebase.

- Monolithic apps are simple to build, test, and deploy compared to a microservices architecture.

- There are times during the initial stages of a business when teams chose to move forward with a monolithic architecture, intending to branch out into a distributed, microservices architecture later.

- Well, this decision has several trade-offs, and there is no standard solution to this.

- In the present computing landscape, applications are being built and deployed on the cloud. A wise decision would be to pick the loosely coupled stateless microservices architecture from the start if you expect things to grow at a significant pace in the future.

- Because re-writing stuff has its costs, stripping down things in a tightly coupled architecture and re-writing stuff demands a lot of resources and time.

- On the flip side, if your requirements are simple, why bother writing a microservices architecture? Running different modules in conjunction with each other isnâ€™t a walk in the park.

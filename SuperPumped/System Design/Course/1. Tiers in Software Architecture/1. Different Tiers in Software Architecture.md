## Single - Tier Applications

A _single-tier_ application is an application where the _user interface_, _backend business logic_, and the _database_ all reside in the same machine.

<br>

Typical examples of _single-tier_ applications are desktop applications like _MS Office_, PC Games or an image editing software like _Gimp_.
<br>
#### Advantages of single-tier applications

1. The main upside of _single-tier_ applications is that they have `no network latency` because every component is located on the same machine. This adds up to the performance of the software.

1. Every now and then, data requests to the backend server stop, making the user experience slow. In _single-tier_ apps, the `data is easily and quickly available` since it is located in the same machine.

1. However, the real performance of a single-tier app largely `depends on how powerful` the machine is and the software’s hardware requirements.

1. Also, the user’s data stays in their machine and doesn’t need to be transmitted over a network. This ensures `data safety at the highest level`.
<br>
#### Disadvantages of single-tier applications

1. One big downside of _single-tier_ apps is that the business has no control over the application. Once the software is shipped, no code or feature changes can be done until the customer manually updates it by connecting to the remote server or by downloading and installing a patch.

1. Due to this, in the 90s there was nothing the studios could do if a game was shipped with buggy code. They would eventually have to face some heat due to the buggy nature of the software. The product testing had to be thorough because there was no room for any mistakes.

1. The code in _single-tier_ applications is also vulnerable to being tweaked and reversed engineered. The security, for the business, is minimal.

1. Finally, the applications’ performance and the look and feel can become inconsistent as the app largely depends on the configuration of the user’s machine.

## Two - Tier Applications

- A **two-tier** application involves a _client_ and a _server_. The _client_ contains the _user interface_ and the _business logic_ in one machine. Meanwhile, the backend _server_ includes the _database_ running on a different machine. The database server is hosted by the business and has control over it.

#### The need for two-tier applications

- Well, yes!! However, there are use cases where _two-tier_ applications come in handy, for instance, a to-do list app or a similar planner or a productivity app.

- In these scenarios, it won’t cause the business significant harm, even if the code is accessed by a third person. On the contrary, since the code and the user interface reside in the same machine, there are fewer network calls to the backend server which keeps the latency of the application low. This is an upside!

- The application makes a call to the _database_ server, only when the user has finished creating their to-do list and wants to persist the changes.

- Another good example of this is the online browser and app-based games. The game files are pretty heavy, and they only get downloaded on the client once when the user uses the application for the first time. Moreover, they make the network calls only to keep the game state persistent.

- Also, fewer server calls mean less money needs to be spent on the servers which is economical.

- Though, if we want to pick this type of tier when writing our service largely depends on our business requirements and the use case.

- We can either keep the _user interface_ and the _business logic_ on the _client_ or move the _business logic_ to a dedicated _backend server_, which would make it a _three-tier_ application.

## Three - Tier Applications



- _Three-tier_ applications are pretty popular and largely used in the industry. Almost all simple websites like blogs, news websites etc. are part of this category.

- In a _three-tier_ application, the _user interface_, application logic, and the _database_ all lie on different machines and, thus, have different _tiers_. They are physically separated.

<br>

<br>

- So, let’s take the example of a simple blog. The user interface would be written using _HTML_, _JavaScript_, or _CSS_, the backend application logic would run on a server like _Apache_ and the _database_ would be _MySQL_. A three-tier architecture works best for simple use cases.

<br>

## N-tier applications

 An _n-tier_ application is an application that has more than three components involved.

What are those components?

-   _Cache_
-   _Message queues for asynchronous behavior_
-   _Load balancers_
-   _Search servers for searching through massive amounts of data_
-   _Components involved in processing massive amounts of data_
-   _Components running heterogeneous tech commonly known as web services_ etc.

All the social applications like _Instagram_ and _Facebook_, large scale industry services like _Uber_ and _Airbnb_, online massive multiplayer games like _Pokémon Go_, applications with fancy features are _n-tier_ applications.

> **Note:** There is another name for n-tier apps, “**distributed applications**.” But, I don’t think it’s safe to use the word “_distributed_” yet, as the term _distributed_ brings along a lot of complex stuff with it. At this point, it would confuse rather than help us. Although I will discuss _distributed architecture_ in this course, for now, we will just stick with the term **n-tier applications**.

<br>

### Why the need for so many tiers?

Two software design principles that are key to explaining this are the _single responsibility principle_ and the _separation of concerns_.
<br>
#### Single responsibility principle

- **Single responsibility principle** simply means giving only one responsibility to a component and letting it execute it perfectly, be it saving data, running the application logic or ensuring the delivery of the messages throughout the system.

- This approach gives us a lot of flexibility and makes management easier, like when upgrading a database server.

- When installing a new _OS_ or a patch, this approach wouldn’t impact the other components of the service running. Additionally, even if something amiss happens during the OS installation process, just the database component would go down. The application as a whole would still be up and only the features requiring the database would be impacted.

- We can also have dedicated teams and code repositories for every component, which keeps things cleaner.

- The _single responsibility principle_ is then reason why I was never a fan of _stored procedures_.

- Stored procedures enable us to add business logic to the database, which is a big no for me. What if, in the future, we want to plug in a different database? Where do we take the business logic? Do we take it to the new database? Or do we try to refactor the application code and squeeze in the stored procedure logic somewhere?

- A database should not hold business logic. It should only take care of persisting the data. This is what the _single responsibility principle_ is, and this is why we have separate _tiers_ for separate components.

<br>

#### Separation Of concerns

- **Separation of concerns** kind of means the same thing, be concerned about your work only and stop worrying about the rest of the stuff.

- These principles act at all the levels of the service, both at the tier level and the code level.

- Keeping the components separate makes them reusable. Different services can use the same database, messaging server or any component as long as they are not tightly coupled with each other.

- Having loosely coupled components is the way to go. The approach makes scaling the service easy in the future when things grow beyond a certain level.

<br>

### Difference between layers & tiers
<br>

> **Note:** Don’t confuse tiers with the layers of the application. Some prefer to use them interchangeably. However, in the industry, layers of an application typically means the _user interface layer_, _business layer_, _service layer_, or the _data access layer_.

<br>

<br>

- The layers mentioned in the illustration are at the code level. The difference between _layers_ and _tiers_ is that layers represent the conceptual organization of the code and its components, whereas, tiers represent the physical separation of components.

- All these layers together can be used in any tiered application. Be it single, two, three or n-tier.

## Trains

Link: https://www.indiabix.com/aptitude/problems-on-trains/

#### Formula

1.  Time taken by a train of length _l_ metres to pass a stationery object of length _b_ metres is the time taken by the train to cover (_l_ + _b_) metres.
2.  Suppose two trains or two objects bodies are moving in the same direction at _u_ m/s and _v_ m/s, where _u_ > _v_, then their relative speed is = (_u_ - _v_) m/s
2.  Suppose two trains or two objects bodies are moving in opposite directions at _u_ m/s and _v_ m/s, then their relative speed is = (_u_ + _v_) m/s.
3. If two trains of length a metres and b metres are moving in opposite directions at u m/s and v m/s, then:
	- The time taken by the trains to cross each other =	`(a + b)/(u + v)sec.`
4. If two trains of length a metres and b metres are moving in the same direction at u m/s and v m/s, then:
	-  The time taken by the faster train to cross the slower train =	`(a + b)/(u - v)sec.`
5. If two trains (or bodies) start at the same time from points A and B towards each other and after crossing they take a and b sec in reaching B and A respectively, then: 
	-`(A's speed) : (B's speed) = sqrt(b) : sqrt(a)`

## Time and Work

#### Formula
```
Work from Days:
If A can do a piece of work in n days, then A's 1 day's work = 1/n


Days from Work:
If A's 1 day's work = 1/n,	then A can finish the work in n days.


Ratio:
If A is thrice as good a workman as B, then:

Ratio of work done by A and B = 3 : 1.

Ratio of times taken by A and B to finish a work = 1 : 3.

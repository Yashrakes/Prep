## Points

1. Data rate using Frequency:
	-  **C(bps) = 2B * log2M (Nyquist)**
	- C is the capacity in bits per second, B is the frequency bandwidth in Hertz, and M is the number of levels a single symbol can take on. This "idealized" capacity equation shows us that data rate is proportional to twice the bandwidth and logarithmically proportional to M.

#### Techniques
1. check if ith bit in num is high:  `num & (1<<i) != 0`
2. set the ith bit in num to 1:  `num | (1<<i)`
3. set the ith bit in num to 0:  `num & ~(1<<i)`	
4. Toggle the ith bit: `num ^ (1 << i)`
5. A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set: `n & (n - 1) == 0`
6. get the rightmost set bit in num:  `setBit = num & ~(num-1)`

## Basic Theory

- `malloc()`: malloc() is a system function which allocates a block of memory in the **"heap"** and returns a pointer to the new block. The prototype for malloc() and other heap functions are in stdlib.h. The argument to malloc() is the integer size of the block in bytes. Unlike local (**"stack"**) variables, heap memory is not automatically deallocated when the creating function exits. malloc() returns NULL if it cannot fulfill the request.
- `free()`: free() is the opposite of malloc(). Call free() on a block of heap memory to indicate to the system that you are done with it. The argument to free() is a pointer to a block of memory in the heap — a pointer which some time earlier was obtained via a call to malloc().

``` cpp
struct node {
	int data;
	struct node* next;
};


/*
 Build the list {1, 2, 3} in the heap and store
 its head pointer in a local stack variable.
 Returns the head pointer to the caller.
*/
struct node* BuildOneTwoThree() {
	struct node* head = NULL;
	struct node* second = NULL;
	struct node* third = NULL;
	
	head = malloc(sizeof(struct node)); // allocate 3 nodes in the heap
	second = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
	third = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
	
	head->data = 1; // setup first node
	head->next = second; // note: pointer assignment rule
	
	second->data = 2; // setup second node
	second->next = third;
	
	third->data = 3; // setup third link
	third->next = NULL;
	
	// At this point, the linked list referenced by "head"
	// matches the list in the drawing.
	return head;
}

```

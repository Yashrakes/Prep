## Points to Remember

- ***Inclusion/Exclusion Principle***
	- Method1 : [[Combination Sum]] (See the code)
	- Method 2:  [Sort and for loop](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/discuss/16502/A-general-approach-to-backtracking-questions-in-Java-(Subsets-Permutations-Combination-Sum-Palindrome-Partitioning)) Important to understand that the array must be sorted

**No of operations per second in C++**
- You can do closer to 2∗1082∗108 operations per second in C++ if those operations are low-level operations (array accesses, additions, bitshifts, multiplies, subtractions, xors, et cetera). Mods and divisions are slightly slower. If you are doing things like hashmap lookups, reading input, or printing output, you can do about 106106 of those per second. If you use Java, the cut-off is maybe 70% what it is in C++, since a lot of things have more overhead, but of course it really depends on what the operations are; sometimes it is closer to 30% of what C++ can do.
